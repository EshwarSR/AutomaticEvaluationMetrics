5987	3	In the story, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” written by Joe Kurmaskie, represents how certain conditions can affect a cyclist. The cyclist was biking through the desert to reach Yosemite National Park, but on his journey he accoutered many tough conditions to make it difficult to get there. First of all, the desert was very hot which makes travel very difficult. For example the text states, “the sun was beginning to beat down.” @CAPS1 makes any task difficult because the sun drain’s a person’s energy. Secondly, the trip was very long so the cyclist had a hard time conserving water. For instance, the man drank so much water, he almost ran out; “The water bottle contained only dehydration which can cause death. Joe Kurmaskie’s story, “Rough Road Ahead. Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” represents how certain conditions of an environment can affect a cyclist.  	2.0	3.0		3.0																					
5988	3	The setting of the authors “ shortcut” effected his performance and strength tremendously . whether it was the hills, heat or barren landscape all three took their toll on Joe Kurmaskie. Not only that, but his lack of water depleted his energy as well.” Flat road was repalced by short rolling hills.” The hills were a tough thing to pass since Joe was being drained of energy. He overcame this exhaustion when a building came into views.” I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage, and tried not to get too excited with what I believed was my last burst of energy. I manouvered down the hill.” The authour overcame all the problems ne faced even though it was difficult. He seems to have written this piece to exaggrate how important it is to keep going when you want to give up. Winston churchill once said, “ success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage it takes to continues that counts.” I believe that @PERSON2 agrees.	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
5990	3	"There was many features that affected the cyclist such as heat and lack of water. The cyclist was drinking a lot of water throughout the story and ends up only having little water left. “I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” That shows he wasn’t prepared with enough water for his trip to Yosemite. Without water he/she would die from the heat. “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke"" This states that he @CAPS1 the danger of not having enough water in his system. Features such as water and heat affected him/her throughout the story. Not having enough water could make him/her lose more sweat and the heat is making him lose even more sweat which can cause extreme heatstroke."	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
6003	3	The cyclist in the story is at first confident in accepting the old men’s help, and doesn’t seem to suspect anything is wrong when he first starts out. The way the men directed him seem all going for his water supply is all in store, and the first land mark, a ghost town now, is exactly where it is supposed to be. The next “town” he hits doesn’t have anything that could replenish his diminishing water supply and he starts to feel troubled. However he was told the next town wasn’t further, so he pressed on. Then the scenery makes a drastic change, the flat roads becoming hills, the sun beating hotter- it really look like a desert after tumbleweeds even go past! The cyclist continues on, despite being very dehydrated. The next thing to come along is an old juice building that almost seems to mark him on how he has no water. He keeps on, however, and at last sees a shop where he can get water. The canging scenery sends the cyclist from confidence to worry, to hopelessness and lastly, relief.	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
6005	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in two way. This ways are pysical and mental. The pysical ways that features affect cyclist is the terrain. If the roads are long and wiredy, this could wear the cyclist out. They could also become physically tired if the incline of the hill is to steep. When it’s you against gravity, it can be egausting. The temperature can also be a crusal factor in a cyclist pysical ability. Nobody want to feel like their in a sauna when they are bike riding. The cyclist and also be attracted mentally. If the terrain looks deserted or anything like a desert the byciclist instintaniously thinks “dehydration” and “death.” If some people see dead animals or bones they would think they could die. If they see vulture circling them they would get afraid and think death, but the worse thing of all is that knowing all of these things are in the same place at the same time. This is how setting affects cyclists	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
6007	3	As the cyclist is travelling to Yosemite National Park, he comes across many features in the area that affects him. First, he takes directions from some old guys who don’t know anything about the changes in maps because they never leave their porch. At first, it affects him in a positive way, because he thought he had a good shortcut to Yosemite. However, the affect later came negative because it turned out to be a shortcut that never existed. Another feature that affected him wasted the setting which was a desert-like area. The heat made it harder for him to ride his bike, and he also drank a lot of his water. This later resulted in him becoming dehydrated. A positive affect was when he found the bait shop, where he rehydrated himself and got some new directions.	2.0	3.0		3.0																					
6014	3	"The terrain during the cyclist’s journey greatly affects him. For example, the first terrain that he experienced was not very hilly, but rather flat and soothing. The author stated, “I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.” This shows that he was energized and happy. However, the reader can predict that the journey will not remain this joyful, because the cyclist is basically in the desert during the summer, in which it is extremely hot. Then, the cyclist experiences hilly terrain that sucked the life from his body, especially because he had no water left. The cyclist said, “sometimes life can feel so cruel"", emphasizing that the cyclist mood had changed from enthusiastic to tired and forlorn.  This change of mood from the terrain can be connected to real life, as obstacles are include, in which the person must persevere and be strong to overcome, in which the cyclist finally did. "	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
6016	3	The narrator in this story goes through a tough journey insisting of hope, challenge physical pain, despair, and relief. All of these are further developed by the settings where they take place, For example after taking advice from old men at a campsite, he is on his way through the deserts of California. If he had been almost anywhere else, his journey could have been much better. He could have gotten more reliable advice, or had been in a place where the towns were not miles and miles apart. Also, at one point he reaches a snake on the road. This could symbolize a decision, which was to go and how it will affect the outcome of his trip, or perhaps the decisions he had already made. To take advice from strangers and better yet he should use it. The irony continues as he becomes dehydrated and the flat land turns hilly. If that weren’t to happen he could have been more successful and healthy on his trip. The setting in this men’s story are necessary for if to have plot line and have the humour it possesses. If he were in the city, for example, he would not get lost and stranded, and therefore would have no story.	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
6026	3	"In the story many different settings affected the author in many different ways. In the very beginning of his journey he came across a ghost town. He reacted to the features of this setting with humor and hope. “I chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on."" He still has hope that he would end up safe and in the right place. The next setting was an abandoned shed with a water pump and a fork in the rode. He grew worried when he saw that no near town was still in sight. “This sight was troubling” when the features of the next setting caught his eye he was desperate and devastated. “At some point, tumble weed crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake” He was on rough terrain in the middle of the desert with little water, when he reached the abandoned @CAPS1’s factory all his hope was lost and when he was planning his death. “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean."" @CAPS2, when he reached the fish camp, he was relieved ""I had overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, Kiss them and buy some bait.” He was overjoyed and overwhelmed because he had survived.    "	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
6027	3	Ghost towns are not exactly the most inviting place for a cyclis trunning low on water supply. In “Rough road ahead: do not exceed speed limit” the cyclist is affected in many ways by his surrounding settings. Starting off on a warm day with the sun bright start off as a good thing, while his mood is still fresh and happy expressions play on his face. But as he moves on he speaks of how “The sun was beginning to beat down” expressing his remorse of listening to the old men that led him on their “shortcut.” Along the road he comes to his first let-down, a ghost town with “one ramshackle shop, several rusty pumps and a corral that couldn’t hold the lamest male.” @CAPS1 he tries to pump the water from the corral but gets a “battery-acid” flavor and is forced to continue onward with little left to drink. This affects his mood to pity for himself and anger at the men who put him into the predicament. By the end he is relieved though when he comes to GARY & @CAPS2 FISH CAMP, a place with a working sink full of cold water. He says he “had an overwhelming urge to seek out @ORGANIZATION1, kiss them and buy some bait.” His thankfulness is expressed to men he doesn’t even know but because they were the light at the end of his long, dark and very exhausting tunnel.	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
6030	3	The setting puts a great deal of stress on the cyclist. The biggest issue he faces is the weather. He is a cyclist “traveling through the high deserts of @LOCATION1 in June.” He had been riding his bike all day and he was soon going to run out of water. Just when he thought he could drink more water, he drank “water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” The weather being so hot and humid, did not help the cyclist throughout his journey. Another factor of the setting that affected the cyclist was the terrain. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,” is a main problem the cyclist faced. These changes in terrain played into the fact that the weather did not cooperate. The hills made the cyclist work harder therefore use more energy. Luckily the terrain had a positive affect on the cyclist as well. The stones he found on the ground, helped keep his mind off the thirst. There were many factors of the setting that negatively and positively affected the cyclist throughout his adventure.	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
6031	3	The narration of “Rough Road ahead” a solo cyclist encounters several challenges throughout the story. The changes in his environment directly affect the completion of his journey and his health. As the narrator makes his way to Yosemite national park from the none of the old men his first encounter with his environment acknowledges his deserve and need for water. The text states “I had been huting my water pretty regularly... the high deserts of California in June”. To disappointed the truck stop’s water supply from the pumps was not adequate for his concumption, only forcing him to link elsewhere to quench his thirst next, he explenced rolling hills by exsercising more energy he made his way now everyone still in need of water. His spend lost his quickness as thoughts of his crippling dyhydration distracted him. He wer came his challenges making his was to a bate shop as the heat beat him unmercifully. The change in his environment challenged his heath and created a obstraction that nearly deterred him from his goal.	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
6033	3	The features of the setting in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” affect the main character the cyclist. The cyclist is biking “through the high desert of california in June.” So naturally it can be infereal that it is not and dry, making water a delicacy. As the cyclist is passing through a ghost town and a pump that releases “a tarlike substance followed by brackish water” he is runningout of his precious water. The surrounding landscape of lonely hills tumbleweeds and snakes does not inspire confidence. In fact, the cyclist feels that “l cald drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June.” He finds an old Grape Juice Factory no longer in service causing more anxiousness and dispare l have had an experience similar to this where l wat out walking in a state park in the @DATE1. I was freezing, and a desolate landscape of snow covered trees made me feel at if I’d never be warm again similar to He cyclist who’s environment made him feel hes wald die of dehydration. So, as can be seen. He setting of this short story affects the cyclist.   	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
6050	3	The setting of this story greatly affects the cyclist’s attitude and adversities. The path of the cyclist is through California deserts, which are dry and hot. This first presents the major conflict of the story, the danger of the cyclist getting heatstake. In the reading, the author says, “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly” If the setting was in a cooler climate, the author would most likely not drank as often, and would not face dehydration. The trip would not have been as dangerous for the cyclist if the climate was different. Another element of the setting that affected the cyclist was the terrain. In the reading it says, “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” The rough road not only would take a toil on the authors body, but also his mind. While riding, the author thinks, “ I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph” This shows how his attitude is getting less and less optimistic as well as keeping his mind on his thirst. Thinking of his thirst would only get him more thirsty. The small change in terrain had a large impact on the authors journey. Perhaps the most influential element of the setting is the isolation. Only until the end of the story does the cyclist run into another human. Up until that point, He was all alone, having to deal with his thirst and fatigue on his own. If the setting had been in a more urbanized area, the cyclist could have gotten help from other people, which would have made his ordeal very easy. Also known, that nobody was going to help him played a large role in the mental state of the author. In conclusion, the conflict of this story was set up by the setting. If the setting were not hot, rough, and isolated, the cyclist would have had an easy journey, and the story would not have been as exciting or interesting. A different setting in my opinion would have ruined the story.	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
6057	3	"The cyclist is traveling through a rough part of California during the hot month of June. The author describes part of part of his journey; ""I was traveling through the high deserts of california in june."" The heat of the sun and not much water around is causing the cyclist to worry about his health. A little further into his journey realizes how bad he could get if he doesn't find water soon. The author write, ""the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke. ""As the cyclist has run out of water & there is no sign of life around, he begins to feel that he @MONTH1 never make it through the desert to yosemite National Park.The author describes this ""I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean. ""The setting of the cyclist""s journey greatly affected how he percieved his journey."	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
6061	3	"The features of the setting in Yosemite give the cyclist something in look forward to, but the feature of the sorting that he is in enduse in get there causes him despaire. As soon as the cyclist passes a ghost town and notices swettering hed of the sun during early endeavers of the trip he checks himself up as he says,""I brely noticed it [the sun], the cool pines and rushing hills of Yosemite had my name written all over them. Although the cyclist began to feel the toll that the trip and the sun was going to take on him, he erased the morning with the hope and bealy of arriving at Yosemite. The more the cyclist noticedthe sun the more he drank untill his water supply seemed low, striping as an old rusty water pump he had hope of being replenished but the taste of bitter battery acid caused the cyclist to stop drinking. The rolling hills, Sun and tumbleweds did nothing to quech the cyclist thirst or at least divert his assertion. If the cyclists was to see a sign that said Yosemite @NUM1 miles away his spirits would have risen, instead he saw a sign that said, ”Rough Road Ahead” which did nothing to help him. If the terrain was more poporsed, easier to travel on and in plenty supply of water, the tune of this passive would be more hoped instead in such despair, the features of the setting caused the cyclist grief instead of hope."	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
6075	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the author changes the mood by not only telling us how the cyclist feels, but also by describing his environment. As he's leaving the “resevoir compground” he’s feeling pretty good because he’s just leaving “the serenity of an early-summer evening and he’s headed toward “The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite.” He’s in a beautiful setting and this affects the cyclist because he’s anticipating another one. However, when he moves to the “ghost town” and the “sun was beginning to beat down” he’s less confident and becoming more doubtful about the mens advice. However, he’s still optimistic, finally it funny that it was once “a thriving little spot.” Next, when the cyclist comes to “one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps and a coral” he knows that things are in bad shape and he @CAPS1 water. However, all the have is a “tarlike substance” so he moves on, having no choice. When he comes to the “rough road tumbleweeds and a ridiculously large snake” it effects the cyclist by letting him know that things are at their worst and he can either give up, or keep pushing through. I doubt it could get any worse, and so does the cyclist. Finally, at the end the cyclists enters a rather modern bathroom” and things are back to civilization for him, so he feels relaxed, relieved and much better. 	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
6079	3	"In the text, the features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist. For example, the text states, “There was no one in sight, not a building, or structure of any kind.” This made the cyclist very lonely and they started to lose hope of finding water. Secondly, the text stated, ""In an ironic twist the building abandoned years easlier, by the looks of it-had been a Welch’s Grape Juice factory” This made the cyclist lose more hope, after he thought the building would have people in it and he got excited. Lastly, the text states, “GRAPE AND @CAPS1’S FISH CAMP” The sight of this building gave the cyclist hope and happiness for finding a place to get a drink. The setting’s features greatly affect the cyclist's feelings."	2.0	3.0		3.0																					
6084	3	There are several features that the cyclist encountered, and all of them affected the cyclist. For example, “several rusty bumps,” is a quote of the text explaining that he wasn’t riding on smooth ground he was riding on rough, hard, bumpy ground. Also he had a huge lack of water he was water depleted he couldn’t even go the speed limit, he was going 12 mph, he could have been going 55 mph. “Rough roads ahead Do not exceed posted speed limit,''  this is another quote expressing the dangers in the ride that he was risking. All these things made the cyclist uncomfortable, dehidrated, and very tired.	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
6085	3	The setting in “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” was a very large factor of the story that was actually the cause of the protagonist’s problem throughout. First it started off with the large hills he had to ride up, making him work harder and tire himself out quickly. Next the big problem was the heat of June, “ and the growing realization that I could drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because ” The heat was so really bad because it made him hot, thus depleting his water supply [which he needed to survive] and it gave the large, almost inevitable risk of falling from a heatstroke and dying. The heat also made the abandoned Juice Factory all the more ironic and bitter for the protagonist. “A sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen.” @CAPS1, in the unbearable heat with no water left and @CAPS2 knows how many miles left to cycle, this really made him feel like the sorriest, unluckiest man in the world. The setting overall, seemed almost crafted to make the protagonist not only suffer from the natural elements, but from things that seemed meant purely taunt him for it. 	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
6089	3	In the eassy “DO NOT Exceed posted speed limit,” It is a clear cut for survival as it seems that this man is fighting to stay alive. As l know cyclists pedal for hours at a time and sometimes for hundreds of miles of he was biking where green grass and cool mountains collide the tone and mood of the essay would of beam completely different.He uses sentences such as “… of two hundred degrees, deteriorating brain, birds would pick me up clean and drop from heatstroke.” @CAPS1 all make me want to read further in the essay to see lf he will be ok by thes end of his journey? I know what the feeling is when you are low of fluids because l have chronic dehydrated. I couldn’t imagine biking and only seeing desert hiss and passing tumble weed. It sounds like an awful experience. If he were somewhere cooler and colorful his experience wouldnt of been so horrific.	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
6091	3	"The features in the setting of ""Rough Road ahead"" affect the cyclist. First of all, the weather causes most of his problems. Since the cyclist was biking in a california desert in June the temperature had to be in the @NUM1's. This causes him to become dehydrated, which is evident when he states, ""I had been hitting my water bottles quite regularly"" The heat therefore causes the cyclist to drive excessively and run out of water, also, the objects the cyclsit comes across on his journey affect him. For example, while riding on a rough path, ""a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me."" This saves the biker progress and most likely scared him. The cyclsit is greatly affected by the features in the story setting."	2.0	3.0		3.0																					
6095	3	"The features of the setting in the essay, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” greatly affected the cyclist. In the beginning of this man’s journey he was confident in his abilities. “I rode in the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.”  The cyclist was prepared for an exciting day and the setting supported this feeling. ""The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them."" @CAPS1, as the setting began to change and his water ran out, the cyclist's attitude changed. He was “traveling through the high deserts of California in June” without much water and begun to feel desperate. As more and more abandoned buildings and deserted towns appeared he went into despair. “At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously larg snake - it really did look like a diamondback-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.” He was in the middle of nowhere with no one around and because of this setting he lost hope of surviving. He thought he was going to die of heat stroke, not having any water left, on these short rolling hills and under the extremelyly hot sun. The cyclist was affected by the features of the setting, going from confidence, to desperation and despair, and then to relief, the changes in setting caused his change in attitude throughout this journey. "	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
6098	3	The setting of the essay didn’t really help the author at all on his journey. There were not many structures on the way. Either that, of the towns said to be, “a ghost town.” @CAPS1 this couldn’t have reassured the author that things were going his way. It also was very hot during his journey. The author says he is “traveling through the deserts of California in June.” Deserts are very hot places and June is during summer which is the hottest month so it had to have been extremely hot and humid. @CAPS1 all this must have taken a toll because he never really saw anything reassuring until the last town he reached with the bait store. So the setting definitely had to have affected his confidence and his energy levels.	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
6105	3	"In the stories, don’t exceed posted speed limit, there are some very descriptive settings. In the stories these settings have a great effect on the cyclist. Through these our settings the effects change. Some good effects some harsh effects. The first setting that is described do you is, ""the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them."" This setting gives you a vivid picture of were the cyclist is heading. This setting also establishes a happy sort of mood. Let the pretty picture is about to change. Not so much further in to the cyclist ride he noticed a change of terrain,"" flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" @CAPS1 the cyclist is short on water, and is becoming very tyered. Seeing this just crushes his spirit. @CAPS1 riding hills hard, but ridding hills with our knowing of something good waiting for you on the other side of the hills. Both of these, very different settings gives off very different feeling. The first one makes you think he is going to have as easy enjoy able bike ride. But this all changes when he hit those horrible hills. Just the thought of having so ride over miles of hills, makes your legs hurt. Over all the features of the setting saposed an intense bike ride for the cyclist, followed by a reward by beautiful place.      "	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
6113	3	The setting easily can affect the cyclist in many ways. The area in which the cyclist was in the seemed to be abandoned which doesn’t give a well thinking to this person . If a town was abandoned or a road was, automatically then won’t be any noticable building structures for a while. Also, the and and shape of the road seemed to be very dangerous for the cyclist not only because of the narrow and rocky path but because of the wildlife. In the text, it says how a diamond back snake, poisoness was directly infront of the cyclist. That example explains on how the wildlife might exceed to more dangerous creature. Finally, the temperature, whether it was hot or cold he cyclist was limited to water & being completely dehydrated was a huge caution for the cyclist. The conditions of the setting of the setting the cyclist was in became a disadvantage for him.	3.0	3.0		3.0

6121	3	The features of the setting greatly  effected the cyclist.  He was  riding along   on a  route he had little confidence would end up anywhere. That being the first time ever being on that rode and having only not of date knowledge about it made the cyclist rework. The temperature was very hot, where was little shade, the   sun was beating down on him. The route was very discouraging .all the cyclist wanted wanted   was water and the route kept touenting him with false hope. At the first town he noticed a water pump, but all he could get of it was sludge and water that tasted like battery acid. Next he came to a deserted old building that approved to be an old bottling factory for Welch’s  grape  juice. The cyclist would appear  to be closing in on something to drink, but be left with nothing.	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
6123	3	The byciclist from “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed speed Limit” was effected in many ways from the environment. The most talked about feature in the environment was the lack of water. The byciclist was going to die because there was no water and he was really dehydrated. Another feature was the heat. It was really hotwhere the narrator was bycicling. When @CAPS1 hot, the heat dehydrates you. So the narrator was being pushed to the limit because of the heat. Also, everyone was gone from the towns so every town he came to was hauntinghim until he got mad at the lodgers hetalked to and was really frustrated. The smooth flat road gave way to rolling hills, which made it harder for him to ride. Lastly, the snake inthe road affected him because he had to avoid it. All of these things affected him. 	2.0	0.0		3.0																					
6124	3	“Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie is truly a story of man against nature. Here is a man who is completely alone except for his bike, the baron landscape and relentless sun. First he notices the sun, over head him, expected from California June, but not none the less. Then next come the rolling hills and incline in elevation, going up hill means his body working, harder, and burning calories and his much needed water supply. Then there is the man much torture. A speed limit of @NUM1,were he is going a tough 12. And worse a billboard of “a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth,” this truly hit his emotions, showing him exactly what it was out of reach. In this story every element of his surrounding contributed to his hoplessness.	2.0	3.0		3.0																					
6127	3	The features of the setting in the story affected the cyclist a lot. In the morning when he began his trip, he was eager and determined to get to his destination. Although it took him forty miles to get   the first “town”, he didn’t seem to mind. “The cool pires and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them,” is what crossed his mind once the sun began to beat down. Meaning that he   didn’t mind or wasn’t   troubled   by it  at the time. But the farther his trip went, the hotter, and less water supply he had left. Once he passed a couple of “troubling sights”, because they were abandoned and no one   was around, he began to worry. The cyclist got to the point that he stated to suck on pebbtes, in order to circulate the last spit he had in his mouth. In his desperation he finally saw a sign for hope that gave him strength in order to continue on. When he arrived at GARY AND @CAPS1’S FISH CAMP,  his   emotions, and mind changed from begin lugubvious, to becoming thankful.	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
6128	3	During his cycling trip, the author had to endure extreme heat, face snakes, deal with little or no shade and survive a dire lack of water, all problems related to the setting of Yosemite National Park. The author, cyclist Joe Kurmaskie, writes of becoming dehydrated, and describes, “the sun was beginning to beat down and l was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” @CAPS1 struggle for him was crossing the path of a “ridiculously large snake” and “trying to keep his balance in his dehydrates state. Kurmaskie ran out of water, due to the extreme heat, and upon reaching a water pump, finds the water to be unfit for drinking and “in the neighborhood of zoo degrees.” @CAPS1 setting-related issue for kurmaskie was the fact the area seemed deserted and he had to continue for mile until he was able to find a spot with clean water where he could rest and rehydrate.	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
6132	3	This is how the setting effects the cyclist. One is the hot dry California desert heat. It was making him hot and thirsty which was making him low on water. The hot desert heat had made water a for like a substance which he could not drink from the well. The water bottle only containe a few tentalizing sips which was not enough to quench his thirst. The hot heat that would make birds pick him drys all of those examples make it hard for the reader to take the old timers advice. It made him realice that in time comes wisely and youth can make silly mistakes. The heat had made it only a trip for his inner soul to survive. That is ho the setting effects the cyclest.	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
6143	3	"There are a couple things that affect the cyclist in the story. One of the ways he is affected is de hydration. In the story about dehydration it says “ The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June.” A good affect on the cyclist was no one in sight to slow him down on his bike ride. A bad affect on him  was don’t ask direction from a guy from heat strokes on a gorgeous day in June simply because listened to some gentlemen who hadn’t been left their porch in decade, caused me to laugh”. One more thing that got in his way was the poisonous snake."" At some point, tumble weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously larg snake--It really did look like a diamond back..

6144	3	The cyclist knowing not where he was going got a wrong enformation and he followed it. He was excited to know that he knows where he’s heading too. Along his journey he was aciccted with a lot of things like the sun. The weather condition of their exaction and the big snake he saw. He was affected by sun because he was dehydrating and he almost had no water left for him as it was also becoming so hot alike makes the journey very difficult for and made his mood strange while also following the direction he was disfernded by a big snake he encounter at the case slic desn't while succeed their add was scared that he was going to be attacked unlike anyone to make his way through. The features affects him because he doesn’t know where he was going and he wait a as her cut.” Then he was going to wrong direction and he wasn’t prepared for the journey because the weather condition was” summer time” it was hot and he was riding a bicycle not a car.	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
6145	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist with his train of thought. On page @NUM1 it says, “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” This gives a sence of heat and foreshadows maybe the lack of water he’ll have later on. As he passes a snake, “trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” So the cyclist is most likely begin to feel dizzy and begins to loose hope. On page @NUM2 he says, “…I could drop from heatstroke…” meaning he’s starting to think of the worse possible things that could happen. Which effects him because he’s beginning to loose hope and  thinks he’s not going to make it. On page @NUM3, he says, “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean…” By this point the conditions he was having were rough and making him worry. This is how the features of the setting affected the cyclist throughout the story.	2.0	3.0		3.0																					
6157	3	The settings have a huge affect on the cyclist. When he first comes to the ‘@CAPS1 town” he isn’t really warried he is kind of laughing and thinks his funny by saying.” This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time  - say, before the last world war.” Then after he says that it ways he chuckled. When he gets the dark in the road with the risky pipe of water he begins to switch into conservation made and begins to get is scared. He says.” I would comer  water- a test at my inner spirit “ This showing that he was scared. After he sees the abanoned Grape juice factory he says something like birds are going to pick him clean and leave behind same expensive biking gear. This definatly shows that he is giving up. Another thing that would back this up is when he talks about writing in his diary about the old men who gives him these direction. When he finally reaches the balt shop he is releved and goes to the bathrom and drinks water. He  also says that he will buy bait even though he doesn’t have a rod. These examples show the many ways the setting affected the cyclist.	3.0	2.0		3.0

Just to add to the misfortune of the story. There was no one in eight, not a building, car or structure of any kind."" This factor does not help the cyclist at all, infact, all it does is make the cyclist more  exhausted. Another element in the story that effects the cyclist is the lack of water. Early on in the story the author explains, ""The water bottle contained only a few tatalizing sips."" With more miles to go,the cyclist starts to loose hope of making it to his destination alive. The feature of rolling hills also affects the cyclist. The cyclist is already tired enough, and just to  add to his misfortune, ""flat roads was replaced by short, rolling hills."" @CAPS1 the hills are short, they still could have put impact on him because of the ropolalive hills.

In the essay, he describes the weather with “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” While this @MONTH1 not directly characterice the weather, the reader can confin a clear image of the sweltering heat of a desert in the summer. When the author comes across the “ghost town” followed by the dilapidated shack, and finally the sign that read “Rough Road Ahead,” his hope of finding Yosemite Park was gone. The hopelessness of the situation made the author want to give up, thinking that he was going to die out in the desert from dehydration and exhaustion. This can be related to anyone that has been lost in unfavorable conditions, and the feeling of helplessness and fear that goes along with it. It feels like everything is against you, with nothing working in your favor, and this is what the author experiences in his description of his trip in “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.”"	3.0	3.0		3.0

6171	3	"The features of the setting strongly affected the cyclist. The rolling hills were the cyclist’s most challenging problem because they were long and cripppling. Maneuvering down the hill would take a lot of energy and determination from the cyclist. Considering the cyclist was already tired and sweating from riding on rough roads and passing a large snake, riding on rolling hills would be extremely difficult. The features of the setting were not helping the cyclist stay healthy because their difficulty was causing the cyclist to become dehydrated and possibly drop from heatsroke. However, the cyclist kept a possitive attitude and did not give up. His determination saved him as he felt relief when he finally came across the ""Gary and wilbells fish camp.” In conclusion, the features of the setting affected the cyclist because they forced him to work extra hard and put forth more effort.

6180	3	In the short story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie. the setting greatly affects the cyclist and his mindset. When the scenery is pretty and cheery, he is happy as well. This is shown when the author writes, “denyoved the serenity of an early- summer- evening.” This quote describes the scenery as a serre or peaceful place. His happiness is found in the first part of the quote when he said, “denyoyed” One does not enjoy something unless they are happy or in a cherry mindset. Therefore, the peaceful scery affected the cyclist by making him happy. the same can be said for merry scenery too. This is found when the author says, “At some point, tumble weeds crossed my path and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke”. This quote, describes the scenery as a place that they tumbleweeds. Steryotypically, tumbleweeds are found in dreary and lonely place. This lonely scenery takes it if full on the cyclist. He becomes pessimist and is making of all that could go wrong, not all that could get better. This is found around us every day. The poor and homeless who live with a low standard of living are often said. They have to exist with the affected the cyclist. In conclusion, the seeing does affects the cyclist and his mindset drastically.	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
6181	3	The features of the setting affect of the cyclist because the setting changed so drastically. The flat wide open road turned into to “short, rolling hills”. Because he was already running out of water it was making harder for him to have the will power and determination to go up and down these hills. His determination started to fade because he started to see wide open lands with nothing but “tumbleweeds and ridiculously large snakes.” He felt like he was going to dehydrate because the sun was beating down and had no water left. He used pebbles that he had found to put in his mouth to help circulate the saliva he had in his mouth.

6182	3	In the story, “Do not exceed posted speed limit”, by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist faces many hardships on his way to Yosemite due to the features of the setting. The fact that it was a hot summer’s day contributed to his hardships. With little water, it was easier for him to get dehydrated. In the text, the author writes, “.I could drop from heat stroke, on a gorgeous day in June.” (Kurmaskie, @NUM1). This lets the reader know that the heat of June was very dangerous to the cyclist. There was also nobody around except “Old timers who haven’t left the confines of their perches since water was in offing” (Kurmaskie, @NUM2). The narrator stresses his viewpoint on taking directions from these people since their directions are as poor. It can be inferred that he meant they was obviously out of date when across directions since the ones they gave him were not correct. The cyclist in this story had a rough time getting to his destination due to the setting.	2.0	3.0		3.0																					
6183	3	The terrain in “Do not exeed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie the cyclist had to cope with many difficulties. He was already lacking water from the anduous journey and then the enviroment turned against him. The narration states, “I noticed the terrain changing flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.”(Kurmaskie @NUM1). This means the cyclist is going to put forth more energy to make it up these hills. Energy he barely has. This  will drain almost all the energy the cyclist has. Another example is, “At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path”(Kurmaskie @NUM1). This means that the cyclist is in the middle of nowhere with barely any water and energy, causing even more problems. In conclusion, the setting in, “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie caused many problems for the cyclist.  	2.0	3.0		3.0																					
6192	3	The features of the setting that the author cyclist through definitely effect not only his mood, but his the physical condition. To start, it is mentioned that he is in “the high deserts California in June,” @CAPS1 it is implied that the weather is hot causing the author to sweat as he bikes along. Next there is a change in terrain an he soon approaches “rolling hills” which are more difficult to bike on. Finally the author sees a sign that reads “ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT” and becomes discouraged because his bike is not even capable of reaching the speed limit but he still has to manage getting past the rough road. After passing this road he approaches a picture of a boy drinking juice that is posted on a juice factory. Seeing this sign most likely perpetuates his thirst and leaves him more exhausted and frustrated before. Such features of his surroundings played a large part in the author’s change in mood.  	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
6194	3	The setting affects the biker in many ways. For one, he is riding through the high deserts of California during the month of June. It is naturally hot in the summer, but in the desert, it is twice as hot. This means he will dehydrate quicker, and will need more water. The only water the biker can find is from an old pump, but he couldn’t drink it since it was so hot; nasty tasting. “When I tried a drop it had the flavor of battery acid” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). His route was deserted, so nobody could help him. Also, the terrain was bad. The hills caused him to use more of his energy, which he needed to stay alive. “the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke caused me to laugh,” (@NUM1). He also encountered dangerous animals like the diamond black rattles back. The setting also affected him mentally because he was silently yelling at himself since he took directions from the old men. He knew he should have taken the right way, instead of trying a short cut that he now realizes is abandoned and dangerous. The biker is being affected in many ways, both mentally and physically.	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
6195	3	  The setting causes major problems for the cyclist in the essay, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” The cyclist was faced with a desert, traveling in extreme humid temperatures and no water. He encounters poisonous snakes and areas of no buildings or civilization all together. The effect on him was the main conflict of the essay. He had no water during some of the trip and lost all hope. He told himself that it was no use. In the story it says, “It didn’t really matter. I was going to die…”. The extreme measures of the setting caused the cyclist to lose control, putting stones in the mouth to stop thinking of his thirst. Over all, the setting caused the cyclist major problems, physically, and mentally.	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
6198	3	"On that long bike ride the cyclist was affected by the setting. He was affected of the lack water, the heat and the bad directions, throughout the story the cyclist ran out of water due to bad directions from some men.""Trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” He ran out of water and became dehydrated through his trip. The heat has a major part of his dehydration during the bike ride.” I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” I have been to California and it is hot. The trip was made even longer due to some bad directions from some old men.” Because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn’t been off their porch in decades, caused me to laugh.” The gentlemen gave him wrong directions because in their time that was right information. But not the land has changed and the directions were wrong. When going on bike rides the setting of the rides is a great help or a bad help.

6208	3	The features of the setting in, “Rough Road Ahead” affect the cyclist. The cyclist started at a camp ground and conversing with some old dogers, and he asks them how to get to Yosemite, and the tell him a shortcut that turns out to be out of date. On the road to Yosemite he sees nothing except abandoned towns. He is really thirsty and there’s no water anywhere. He thought he was going to die. He said, “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” It was a hot summer day and there was tumbleweeds and snakes by the road and him feel hotter and more thirsty than he would be if it was cooler and if there was a big river flowing by the road.

6223	3	Some features of the setting affect the cyclist on his journey to Yosemite. Starting off, ad men who haven’t seen the changes this world made for about a decade, gave the cyclist a bad start. If the cyclist wouldn’t have gotten the shortcut information, he wouldn’t have been without water in abandoned towns. When the cyclist arrives at some rusty pumps, he decided to check it out and see if there is any water. The water was really not and it tasted like battery acid. The cyclist decided to keep going, even though he was running out of water. When he came to a snake in the rode, he had to get by his “dehydrated state.” I would imagine this would be dangerous if you couldn’t focus well in the road. He then came upon @ORGANIZATION1 that has do and abandoned. He obviously couldn’t get any water there seeing as how bad of condition the building was. When the cyclist had no water, he became dehydrated and unfortunately there were no stops for water on his journey that day to Yosemite.	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
6225	3	"The cyclist's adventure was very much affected by his setting. It seemed as though the worse his setting became, the worst he personally felt. For example, when he hit the ghost town, he just laughed. Once he got to the fork in the road, he saw less of once exisiting civilization, and he says, ”This sight is troubling,”. Once he moves on, he gets more discouraged by the ""Rough Road Ahead"" sign. It seems as though the more dehydrated he gets, the worse things became for him. The climate in the story also becomes @CAPS1 difficult. The land at first was flat and easy to ride, as it got harder to bike on, the cyclist grew @CAPS1 wary and delievious, but knew he had to keep going. The area in which the cyclist was in, had an enormous effect on him emotionally."	2.0	3.0		3.0																					
6226	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making him in a near death situation. He said “sometimes life can be so cruel.” because he was running out of water, running out of strength, and running out of patience. Also a snake ""it really did look like a diamond back,” could have killed him. He was in the desert and anything could happen.

6228	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a very serious way. The features cause him to consider he @MONTH1 die soon, as well as present a variety of challenges to him. The setting takes place in the deserts of California, in early summer. There are no other people in there, no establishments, towns, etc. ; @CAPS1 dangerous feature of the setting in addition to it being in a desert in summer, for example the author is the town learntedat “might have been a thriving little spot at one time-sat, before the last world war’. The cyclist is given almost a hopelessness as well as determination to survive as he runs out of water. For example he says “I was going to lie…slowly gaining elevation while losing hope”. The author makes the trip to a fishing camp and survives. He lerns, because the setting the setting is now lifeles and deserted, to not listen to old people who remember the current setting on if as it was many decades earlier.

6240	3	The features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” by Joe Kurmaskie. The setting effects how fast, hard and long the cyclist needs to pedal. For example, “…Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” The cyclist was going 12 mph, where the speed limit was 55 mph. The cyclist was beginning to lose hope after reading the sign, but he kept going. Furthermore, not only was the land add pressure to the cyclist. So does the heat from the sun. For instance, the cyclist says, “… and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke…”. The heat begins to affect the authors health and his perseverance. The setting affect the mental and physical strain the cyclist has to endure.	2.0	3.0		3.0																					
6245	3	"The features of the setting affect the cy clist in many ways. For example the lack of water was the biggest thing. Without cool water he had nothing to reboost his energy. He would get tired out faster. Even he does find water its hot, like when he says,” brakish water feeling some where in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” This shows how in “the high desert of June,"" the water is all very hot. Even after he pumped the well for several minutes the water still wouldn’t cool down the hot desert had baked everything above and below ground. So when you go to get something liquid which heats and cools faster than solids it will be hot. Also the rough road made it difficult for the cyclist to travel it. We know the roads rough when he says, “large highway signs dumped out at me. It read ROUGH ROAD AHEAD DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT. ""This also shows you couldn’t go fast."	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
6247	3	The harsh setting in “DO Not Exceed Posted Speed limit “by Joe Kurmaskie made the @CAPS1 for the cyclist more difficult due to the hot weather and the inconsistancy of the pavement. The very hot June day was a cause of the cyclist slowing down. “wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt and the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June.” This proves that the cyclist is very hot due to the summer heat. Another factor of the cyclist slowing down is the inconsistant of the pavement on the road “Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.” The @CAPS2 proves that the road could be slowing the cyclist also. It seems the cyclist has a lot against him. But if he keeps his head up he can make it to “Yosemite.”	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
6249	3	Several features of the setting that affected the cyclist were time of year, the desert land, the lack of civilization, the lack of resources – especially water, and the rugged characteristics of the land. The cyclist was traveling during the summer time, which was the hottest time of the year. He was also traveling through the deserts which create an even hotter climate. “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June,” was a quote from the selection that tells us this. If he had been traveling in the @DATE2, for example, he @MONTH1 have been more comfortable. Throughout his trip, the author does not after come desert civilization. He runs into a deserted factory and miles of land without people. The fact that he is traveling through desert terrain also helps us realize that water is scarce. He has trouble finding a place to get water. This made the trip extra hard and discouraging. “I was going to die” he says. As he travels farther, the land also becomes harder to travel on. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills” this characteristic is a setting, like the others, negatively affects the cyclist by making his journey harder.	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
6250	3	"The cyclist surrounds did have an affect. In paragraph two the cyclist describes how “I enjoyed the serenity of an early-summer evening the."" To have a wonderful day to begin with was parably assurance even thing would be fine. Confidence was a factory for the beautiful weather as well as he knew a short cut. In paragraph @NUM1 the cyclist mentions how old men looked at his map and pointed out “this breezy jaunt.” The cyclist just thought his life got a little easier. Then in paragraph @NUM2 the cyclist comes upon the ""traditional definition of a ghost town."" This setting was nothing like the old men were talking about. ""Twenty miles up the road, i came to a fork of sorts."" In paragraph @NUM3, this caused confusion and worry. ""This sight was troubling."" ""I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June."" The cyclist was ""hitting my water bottles pretty regularly."" This setting made the cyclist uncomfortable as well as the ""two hundred degrees."" The cyclist then began puzzled and distraught.

But as the day gets more hot and the terrain more desert like and cough, the cyclist begins to lose his confidence, as he keeps riding, his water supply is depleting and he begins to believe that he will die. At one point, talking about the terain he says,"" i toiled on at some point, tumbleweeds crossed any path."" It sounds as if he is struggling very hard to keep going without water and a clue about where he is. When he is almost sure that he is going to die from the queruring that he says,"" i was going to die and the birds would pick me clean”. This shows that by this time his confidecnce was lost because of the insane heat and unberable terrain.

6254	3	The features of the settings affect the cyclist in many ways when he starts of, he is bright and happy just as the slenecy is nice and calming. There is a pace that makes him feel like nothing wrong. “I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.” After about @NUM1 miles on the cold, his life was getting low, and he came to his second abundant place. He then felt a little disturbed and worried. He needed to find a place with water. “This site was trebling.”  There he fins water plant not his hopes rise a bit, until he finds the water isn’t good. “A tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brickish water feeling some which is in the neighborhood of two hundred trees”. So he moves on and finally he re aches life!

6262	3	"In the essay Do not exceed posted speed limit by Joe Kurmaskie, the surrounding setting affected the cyclist. The setting was somewhere outside Lodi, California in early summer. The cyclist took advice from some old men that led him to difficult places to get out of. As the sun made things better and his water started to deplete getting to Yosemite was much harder. The cyclist was traveling through high deserts of California in June. When the terrain started to change from flat road to rolling hills the cyclist pushed himself even harder to get to his destination. The sun and hot air dehydrated him faster. After traveling over, ""along, crippling hill,”  the cyclist had to stop and even tried sucking on apebble in an effort to take his mind off thirst. When he found a habited store he was exhausted and relieved. Then features of the setting had a big effect on the cyclist. The weather dehydrated him while the terrain exhausted him.   "	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
6263	3	The settings in the essay affected the cyclist mentally and physically The fact that he was riding through the desert in June affected how long his water supply lasted. If he had been riding in the @DATE1 then his water supply would’ve lasted longer and he would’ve had more energy. Since the town the old men had told the cyclist about was abandoned that also affected the cyclist because he had to keep on going even though he was getting weaker. What affected the cyclist most, I think was when he arrived at the bait store. If that had been abandoned like everything else, the cyclist would’ve died. Luckily though it wasn’t and he was able to drink water.The factory affected him mentally because the picture of the boy was haunting him in a way due to the fact he was drinking juice something the cyclist could’nt do. All in all, I think the conditions that the cyclist was in affected him. Since I’ve fainted from dehydration before I know how it feels to be without water. First you get a head ache; then your mouth dries up and desperation gets in and finally you get dizzy. 	3.0	3.0		3.0

The positive effect makes the cyclist healthy and safe once again. The setting mentally, @CAPS1 the cyclist very substantitially. This can be seen when the cyclist in the comfortable camp around in @LOCATION1. He feels happy in this area. This positive effect prepares the cyclist to go on the trip to Yosemite. Also, when the cyclist reaches the “Ramshackle @CAPS2, several rusty pumps, and a corral, “he feels troubled. He is negatively affected mentally by the little amount of available water. In addition, the cyclist felt ""sad"" and ""hopeless” when cycling in the Dry, arid terrain. The cyclist is in the worst mental state in this place. Finally, the cyclist felt relieved upon seeing the fish camp. He describes the feeling by saying that his trouble are now “behind” him.

6267	3	The setting of the essay, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” effects the cyclists physical and emotional attitude. In the beginning of the essay the cyclist, “rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on [his] face.” It was not too hot yet in the morning. So, the cyclist was happy and strong. He was confident he could conquer anything. As the day grew on “the sun was beginning to beat down” He was beginning to drink lots of water but he was still confident and strong. “I came to a ramshackle shed [and] several rusty pumps the sight was troubling. “The cyclist was travelling in the hot deserts of California. He was becoming tired and thirsty. He had to save as much water as possible. What started as a confident ride into the desert became a survival ride. Once the cyclist findswater he is relieved.

6268	3	As the cyclist begins his journey, he is confident & exited to have been offered new directions from some “old wise men” which promise a shortcut. This water supply is mediocre & attitude willed against the flat and hilly terrain, untill he realizes the directions are way off  target. The cyclist was making his way to Yosemite when he came to the first “town” but it wasn't a town but more of a ghost dwelling. As he continued hoping the shortcut offered by the old “codgens” would actually materialize, he realized he was utterly alone in the hot desert wt a depleting water supply & dwindling spirit. He was disturbed that he had chosen to follow the advice from the older men and through his his pain & dispair, encouraged himself by deciding he would never listen to their type again. The cyclist felt skrewed over, yet through his will & determination, by rationing water & mentally choosing to cycle for each hill one at a time, he endured his physicall, emotional & mental trials and lived to learn the valuable lesson of never consulting old “ codgers” on mapping issues, because their information would most likely be out datted.	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
6270	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist greatly in his determined ride. At first he seemed at case talking about the cool pines and rushing rivers he was going to encounter once getting to Yosemite. After a strenuous ride he started to get nervous and wonder if he was even going to survive. He was running out of water and he thought be a diamondback. Once he reached the rolling hills he saw a posted speed limit sign saying not to exceed the speed limit of 55 m.p.h. He was doing a ''water depleting 12 m.p.h. wonder how he was going to survive. At the end of the rolling hills he came to an old Welch’s grape factory wondering his life was so cruel. After that he was determined to survive and make it to his destination. He picked out spoke on horizon and rode to them makes his way across the desert. The finally made it to “Only and wilbers fish camp where he know he was safe and would survive.	2.0	3.0		3.0																					
6276	3	As if along bike ride through the city isn’t grueling enough, the author of this story had it much worse. First the climate was a recipe for a disaster. “High deserts of California in June.” @CAPS1 is clearly a debilitating factor as is direct sunlight and humidity. If the cyclist did not have the proper gean he could be hurt by all three of these factors. Secondly, “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” @CAPS2 his endurance is being tested because it is going for tolerance energy and will power to climb each individual hill. Most importantly, with his lack of water in his bottles, all of these characteristics were harmful. Within a desert, water is to be found nowhere. In hot weather, the water bottles will turn warm and in sunlight, water could even evaporate. To me, it seems like the setting and the weather were the perfect combination for doing much more harm than good.	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
6280	3	The features surrounding the cyclist effect him greatly. All he has around him are hills, rough terraine, sand + tumble weeds. These features leave him thinking he will die because there is no life around him. Everything is dry + vivid + thats how it makes him feel. The old, rusty water pump shows that it hasn’t been used in ages + the black tar pumped out is no help to his negative thought of life.	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
6282	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the author uses features of the setting to show the effects of the cyclist. In the essay the rider gets directions from two old men on a perch. In the essay it said, “Never accept braid advice from  a collection of old- timers who haven’t let be able centres of their porch since carter was in office. “This shows the old man could be wrong and places can change. Also, on this short cut he almost runs out of water. The essay ststed I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or se – a test of my inner spirit. He is running out of water but has the determination to get to @CAPS1 last the terrain affects him. The Hills prove to be a challenge with a limited supply of water. The essay states. Flat roads were upleed by sheed, rolling hills. This shows he is extremely determined. Even though the hills added to the struggle he made it through. That is how the author used features of the setting to add to the struggle of the cyclist.	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
6284	3	After the cyclist spoke to the “old timers who hadn’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office,” his confidence in them began to ware. He entered the desert happy, hopeful and determined. As his water reservoir began to disappear, and he approached the sight of the old shed, canal and a couple water pump, he began to feel touched. He made an attempt to get the water from the pumps and it was hot and “tested like battery acid”. As he rode on, his confidence only faded more. He travelled through the desert and “ridiculously large snake” and was running low on water. Finally he saw a building in the distance, which ironically enlights was an abandoned juice factory a sign featuring a left sipping on some succulent icy liquid teased ruin, and he began to lose hope. He didn’t think he would make it to his destination or anywhere else for that matter. Although after approaching the old factory, he came across a bait shop where his hope and energy was founded.	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
6286	3	There were many features of the setting that affect he cyclist to make his difficut journey to Yosemite. First, it was the old timers at the reservoir campground. They might have been old, but not very wise. For example, “I followed their advice and launched out at first line, nd along a ‘short cut” that was toslice away hours from my ride to Yosemite National Park.” This is describing how the cyclist takes the short cut from the old timers which almost gets him killed @CAPS1, the sun had a warming affect on the cyclist causing him to dehydrate. For example, “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularlyand I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” This is showing you an image of just how hot the climate he is in. Finally, a lack of water can cause major problems, such as heatstroke or dehydration, yoth which can lead to death. For example “I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June…” This is stating without enough water to keep him cool he felt as if he were going to die.  	2.0	3.0		3.0																					
6287	3	"In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting often affects the character. One example of this is when the character got to a place where there was nothing. “One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mule greeted me”. This quote explains that the character (cyclist) was confused. Another example of this harsh setting is when the water in his bottle feels @NUM1 degrees. “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” That quote suggests that it is hot outside, which would make the water hot. Another example of the setting is when the terrain changed. ""@CAPS1 road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" This made the biker have to work harder, and use more energy. These conditions all made the cyclist have to work harder to find his destination."	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
6292	3	During the cyclist’s trip, he experienced physical and mental strain. The intense heat, rough terrain, the animals and his isolation all contributed to his strain while completing his challenging task. His isolation while cycling down the “shortcut” was a definite factor in his strain. @PERSON1 stated that, “ there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” All @PERSON1 had to focus on was accomplishing his task. There wasn’t anybody nearby to help him and there wasn’t any shelter for him to take to escape the heat. The heat itself played a very predominant factor in Kurmaskie’s physical strain. The heat caused him to become dangerously thirsty and required him to find an abundance of water fast. Kurmaskie stated, “ the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke” This statement proves that the intense temperature was a life threatening factor. The rough terrain and snake and two factors in his trip that just helped make his journey even more cruel. The physical strain of avoiding a snake in the middle of the road and the dangerous terrain just put him in a more grading position. 	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
6300	3	In “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist by gradually wearing him out and pushing his limits of hope and survival skills. At first, the cyclist enters a deserted town but he remains calm and amused by this in the sentence, “I chuckled, check my water supply, and moved @NUM1). Soon after, the cyclist is troubled by a “ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, through the high deserts of California in June” (@NUM2). He is agitated by this, makes a significant dent in his water supply, and unfortunately continues. At the point where he is still isolated and lost beyond repair, the cyclist tries to stay hopeful but soon breaksdown. He reflects, “Telling myself that of I could make it that far, I’d be @NUM3). The features of the setting become more and more disappointed at each leg of the journey for the cyclist.	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
6301	3	In the beginning of the cyclists journey, he is very happy and carefree. The cyclist comes to the first deserted town the setting isn’t described because the cyclist is not worried yet. After leaving the first town the cyclist barely noticed the heat because, “the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them.” The cyclist still has high spirits. The cyclist begins to get thirsty when he comes upon a water pump. He attempts to get water but the pump isn’t in working condition. Until this point in the story to road has been mostly flat and straight. Then the cyclist notices that the road has some hills in it. At this point the cyclist has no water and is very dehydrated. After one hill the cyclist sees a building. The building is an abandoned grape juice factory, which is ironic considering the state the cyclist is in. The cyclist sucks on rocks as a last resort and gives up hope of living , when he comes upon a fish camp. He gets water from the bathroom and all is well. The setting in this story affects the cyclist because as the setting changes, so do the cyclist moods and feelings about survival and the danger he is in.	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
6305	3	The setting it the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” in three ways. One way is that it is very baren so there is no shade to stop the sun that is beating down the the cyclist body which adds to his dehydration and lack of to focus. Another way the setting affects the cyclist is the terrain the rolling hills, and desert he bikes through the hills make him work harder using up more energy and exsusaing his ater supply the desert also with it enemies heat make his not trust himself thinks there mirages he sees. The last way it affects him is the ghost towns when he sees them he get a hope of relief that he might get water and out the heat but when he passes in he finds nothing and leaves him chrested and think of death.	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
6308	3	The setting effects the cyclist because he is in the California desert in June without water. He is also cycling up and down curry, hilly back roads. The cyclist eventually starts to lose water and his determination is tested as he struggles to get to the next town. He says “wide rings of dried sweet circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some old gentlemen who hadn’t been off their porch in decades. Caused me to lough.” The author is showing how the circumstances he is in are taking a toll on him. He also states a road sign “Rough Road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit.” This is ironic because he is already exhausted and now he is about to encounter a treachorous stretch of road. I have never cycled for long periods of time and can hardly imagine being pushed to such a state of exhaustion. I can relate it to a time I was played @NUM1 soccer games during the summer heat. It was painful and everytime I received the ball it took all I had to tack it.	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
6310	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways because it’s almost like the background and theme of the cyclist The features used in this story are mostly about the background in which he is going and the sites of where he is. He’s showing the reader of how much he needs somewhere to go and also now much he’s indespair at the time. When he says “It was sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but atleast I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself.” In this quote he is saying that he @MONTH1 be tired and physically not be in his best shape but atleast he knows he’s not in a good shape and he knows he’s in trouble, but he can still laugh it off and aware but he keeps trying anyways. This text in my opinion is showing many different ideas such as hope, awareness, and ability and courage to realize you need help but go on anyways to prove to yourself you can finish what you wanted and planned to do.	2.0	3.0		3.0																					
6313	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The cyclist persevered through the rough terrain which caused him to become weak. For example, the author states “looked the majority of the pavement in front of me and ceased past tilling to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” This shows the author is dehydrated because it is so hot and he kept going even with a physical obstacle. Another thing that affected the author was that he felt like giving up because the terrain was too harsh. For instance in the text, “it didn’t really matter I was going to die and the birds will pick me cleary waveng only some experience outdoor gears.” This shows that the author still had to go even when time get tough. The text shows how exhausted he is by the winds eating at him when he dies. He would dehydrate to the humidity of the desert and heat. In other words, the features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways.	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
6330	3	"The features of the setting in which the cyclist is in change his outlook on the trip. When he first begins his trip, the road is fine, so he becomes confident. When the terrain began to change, he writes, “sometimes life can feel so cruel”, he grows despairing as he faces new terrain with so little water. When he begins to see a building, he becomes hopeful and determined. However, when he realizes its old juice factory, he grows bitter. When he leaves the factory, he feels ??? all hope. The comparison can be shown when he writes, “somehow i climbed away from the abandoned factory of of juice and dreams, slowly gaining elevation while losing hope."" @CAPS1 the end, when he is revived with water he almost looks back on the journey comically. The rider knows that his out look drastically changed depending on setting through his journey"	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
6331	3	The features of california and the fact that the cyclist was neave Yosemite made the terrain rugged and dangerous to the cyclist california has a very hot climate, and is neove  a desert, so the need for water for the cyclist was much greater man if the had been cyclist in @LOCATION1. In the story, the cyclist had to travel through desert-like conditions with a limited water supply. The cyclist even mentioned in the story how many hours into the ride the land changed to “ short, rolling hills,” which would have made it harder to pedal, and making him work harder, in the story, he also mention how the sun was beating down on him, and that would alos serve as a factor thout helped deplete his hydration. Through all of the problem the cyclist faced nowever, he managed to stay determined, when other people faced with his problems might not have been able to make it through. Also, in the story you @MONTH1 notices that in the different stages of his struggle, the authours tone ananger from confidient , to unsure, to desser	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
6332	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. It made him tired thirsty and he was near exaustion.	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
6333	3	The cyclist in the essay “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” took the advice of older gentlemen who offered him a shortcut they knew to get to @CAPS1 national park. However, the land had changed long ago after these men were last here. The fist town he came upon was a realistic version of a ghost town. He laughed at how long ago those men must have been here. Long hours on the hot road and with dipleted water, @CAPS2 sank in. He lost almost all hope when he reached an old and destroyed grape juice factory. He had made it to a bait store for water at last. He would never take the advice of anyone but his map again.	2.0	3.0		3.0																					
6335	3	"In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”many features of the setting challenge the cyclists.The cyclist accepts information from foreign old people which made his first mistake.After realizing this he,“I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly,and i was traveling through the high deserts of California,in June”the lack of water plus the heat in California,in june would have turned to heatstroke for most people.Even further into the journey,even with all those things against him it states,“flat rode was replaced by short,rolling hills,""@CAPS1 not only did he have excessive heat,and no water,but @CAPS1 he was handed troublesome rodes too.Although the cyclist must have been near to complete exhaustion,he continued through.Fighting all adds,and elements,many features in the setting of this story affected the cyclist,but he overcame them honorably."	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
6336	3	"The dry desert like setting would affect the cyclist because he could easily become dehydrated from the sun, and loss of water through sweat. The cyclist states, “I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state” (Rough Road Ahead). The man is badly dehydrated, but in his determination he moves on. The terrain went from being flat, to short rolling hills. The road had been abandoned along with the town he had passed through, hoping to get water. The man goes can to say, “ I toiled on, at some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake- it really did look like a diamond back- blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me ""(Rough Road Ahead). The setting is obviosly desert like, so it is dry, hot, and dusty. This would definately have an affect on his body which is sweating, which causes dehydration due to water loss. In conclusion the cyclist was greately affected by the setting."	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
6340	3	"The story Rough Road ahead: Do not exceed Posted Speed limit"" by Joe Kurmaskie was about a man traveling through some pretty difficult settings. The cyclist’s mood was detirmined by the setting as well as his needs and his detirmination to make it. The setting of the story early summer in California. The weather is described as hot as, ""The sun [began] to beat down."" He, ""was traveling through the high deserts of @CAPS1 can June."" Because of the excessive heat, he needed more water, which shortly became the conflict of this story. As things got more difficult his attitude towards the old men’s advice changed from gracious for their help to wishing he had never listened to them. Also as the difficulty increased his detirmination to move on also increased by, ""telling [himself] if [he] could make it that far, [he’d] be fine."" @CAPS2 for the cyclist, the settings affect was negitive.     "	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
6347	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist for a few reasons. One reason is that it makes it easier to picture how the cyclist feels. Also it makes the cyclist seem a bit insane for doing what he’s doing in weather that he could, “drop from heatstroke.” @CAPS1 reason is that the weather is affecting the cyclist so bad that he’s seeing a mirage of a “building-abandoned years ealier.” The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the conditions seem impossible to make it in.	2.0	3.0		3.0																					
6349	3	In the article “Do not exceed the posted speed limit,” the features of the setting took toll on the cyclist in many ways. First off the whole Setting was a dry, dusty not desert that would chair anybody. “The sun was beginning to beat down, but i borely noticed it.” The own affected the cyclist by dehydrating him so much, which bring me to the next point. “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly and i was traveling through the high deserts of california in June. This caused him to become even more dehydrated, resulting in him thinking he was going to die. Along the way he found an old abandoned juice factory. This affected him by filling him with despair and hopelessness, causing him to push more and more to reach water. In the end the feature of the setting only made him more determined to reach water.	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
6351	3	Many of the features of the setting effect the cyclist. The most obvious and direct feature would be that this adventure took place in the “high deserts of California in June.” @CAPS1 about that passage says blistering heat; high meaning its going to be closer to sun, deserts, where the world is hot, California, which is known to be smoggy, and June, which is the middle of summer. Also, the closet water supply was “somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees,” there was a “long crippling hill” all while the sun was heating down.  All of that would most obviously effect the cyclists by making him tired, which he vividly explains by expressing his fears of losing conscionous.	2.0	3.0		3.0																					
6353	3	As the cyclist goes on his trip, he is met with many dreary places and people. For starters, the old men he knew he shouldn’t have trusted but did any way. This led him through the desert. Even in a car the desert can be a very despairing place. On a bicycle it must be even worse knowing that if you run out of water op one will be there to save you from dehydration. Just the endlessly bleak landscapes also played a roll in the cyclist feelings. Another bad feature is the endless amount of abandonment towns and spoiled water. Every time he thought he was saved he was put down again by that fact. For example he had to pump for minutes only to get bad tasting water. Finally just when his strength was to give out he found the bait place & water and that dramatically and a place to rest too bad there was another old man there, isn’t it?! 	2.0	3.0		3.0																					
6363	3	"The features of the setting effect the cyclist in, “Do not Exceed posted speed Limit.” By changing him physically. He was in the California desert in the middle of June without any water left. This was taking a physical toll on him. His physical effect was making him feel hopeless as well. He says, “It was a sad hopeless laugh mind you, but at least l still had the energy to feel sorry for myself."" So the way he was suffering from dehydration physically effected his emotional state because he felt as though there was nothing he could do. Had he been in another place, for example @LOCATION2, where it does not get newly a shot as soo thon California, he would not have been suffering from dehydration, as have been in such an isolated place. His cycling could be compared to the climbers who were lost in the snow storm in @LOCATION3. Instead of dehydration and heat strone, however they suffered from hypothermia. Had they been on a different mountain, there would have been no snow storm and they would be fine. The outcome of this story and the climbers was determined by their setting."	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
6364	3	The conditions gave the cyclist no hope at some points because the heat of the land the of the features of the setting were so harsh he had no hope like when the cyclist says I hope I make It to the horizon because theres nothing else to compare. He can’t say lets ride to the next building or mail box because there are none. The desert features make the cyclist fell that its just him no one can help him he’ll die of dyhydration. Then the features get worse he sees the welchs grape fruit building giving him little hope of survival then he finds out that its deserted and that’s like the final thing he gives up. The cyclist almost unconscious then runs into the fishing store where he has a sip of water. So the features were the main reason the cyclist lost hope.	2.0	3.0		3.0																					
6366	3	The features of the setting in “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” affect the cyclist greatly. In the cyclists opinion things began pretty well. He had a positive attitude as it states “with strong legs and a smile on my face.” As the man moves on he comes to a fort of sorts. To him, the sight was troubling. Though troubling, he still had the confidence that he could continue. Next he noticed the changes in the terrain. He explained “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” This means that he would have to peddle harder and with greater force in order to get over the hills. The weather was not and the cyclist was running out of water. The possibility of heatstroke came to mind. “There was no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind”, as told by the man. His mind entered a state of sad, and hopeless thoughts, but he persevered and cycled on. At this point he was very thirsty and felt his death was near. He said “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean” As he kept going he spotted an old guy in sight. He regained hope and moved ahead. The features of this story affected the cyclist physically and mentally. Physically he was tired and worn out. A like this horrible state, mentally he was becoming negative and pessamistic about his travel. The setting's features interfered with the cyclist's physical and mental state.	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
6371	3	"In this narritive of a cyclist, riding in california, and handed for Yosemite national park, he encounters a lack of water and bad directions from a group of old men on a pourch. The setting plays a big part in his ""challenge"", from the pine trees to the barren hills. In the begining of his trie he passes a ""gbost town"" that has clearly seen better days. This presents him with his first doubt and he continues with caution. Then the pines that, ""had my name written all over them."" This gives him hope and reassurance. Then the rusty pump and ""ramshackle shed."" They took the hope and reasurance away, making him cautrous. The hills that made him work hard to get over, the snake that slowed him down and the whelches juice company that was abundanded all didn't help and made matters worse. Then he got some water at a bathroom and it was all better. It the setting has less the same the whole way he wouldn't have had any hope or he would have hope but it wouldn't fall and rise, making the story interenting.   "	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
6377	3	In the essay “Rough Road ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the setting relates to how the author is feeling. At first, when the author sees the abandoned first “town” he is not too worried about it and moves on. “I chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on. The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it.” The author is okay right @CAPS1, and still has enough water. Next he starts to get low on water, and he becomes more panicked; which in return makes the day seem even hotter. “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of california in June.” @CAPS1 that the author is low on water the day seems worse afterward he continues on and runs into a rattlesnake, which makes him even mere panicked “and a ridiculously large snake. It really did look like a diamond back-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased past, trying to keep my balanc in my dehydrated state.” @CAPS2, when he got to the bait store and drank from the sink; things didn’t seem so bad anymore and there was no more talk about water nor the heat. As a result the setting was related to the author’s moods.	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
6378	3	The features of the setting did affect the cyclist in this small story. In this story the setting is a hot dry terrain which can be better explained by the name California. This heat of the desert climate seems to start have an effect on him about after he reaches the first town. I know this by his statement.”This place might have been a thriving little spot at time –say, before the last war-but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. I chucked, checked my water supply and moved on. The the sun was beginning to beat down. The summer heat is thriving how during this @DATE1 and he is drinking lots of water.”So this setting does affect him greatly it causes him to use his water supply and it causes him to begin the process of dehydration. I know how the summer heat can affect you during @DATE1 activity ‘s. At times it feelslike you are going to die but that building is always around the bend just for the cyclist.  	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
6379	3	"In Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, the features of the setting are devastating to the cyclists condition. ""@CAPS1 through the high desert of California"" is surely never an easy task to begin with. Without proper hydration, people often suffer heatstrokes or pass out, sometimes even perishing, it is entirely worse for this cyclist because of the effort he is exerting, pedaling over “short, rolling hills.” Even worse, the trail a few very old, eccentric men set run on doesn’t do much in the way of nuping with a depleted water supply. The first town the cyclist comes across easily splits “the traditional definition of a ghost town” and the only other water pump he comes to emits only sewage and incredibly hot brackish water. Therefore, the heat is only made worse by the look of water on the cyclist path. This combination of features in then setting causes a great deal of distress to the cycling, and almost pushing him to death."	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
6381	3	"In the beginning of the story the author is happy, but towards the end grows upset. ""I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face” (@NUM1). This shows how the author is in a good mood and happy to be there. She is on a journey, and no one can touch her. Then the story takes an unexpected turn. “With what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill,” (@NUM2). After getting lost in a town that seems distant from any living things the author hears people! She is extremely reliefed to have found anyone of help to her. She gets water and is forever greatful. The setting is horrifying to her because you will feel like you cant even if you live there! She felt alone and that she would die. If the setting was in a city surrounded by buildings the author would still feel some security even without water"	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
6384	3	Features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. After about @NUM1 miles, when in need of water supply the cyclist found a rusty pipe which a tarlike substance came out, then a brackish water substance. While cycling, you are in need of clean water. Next, the terrain changed from being flat to very hilly. In need of water,the last thing you need is be to be challeged more. Later on down the food, there were no cars or any buildings in sile. When you are feeling the the worst, you would want someone to he near in case you fall out, but no one was in site on that road. Lostly, seeing the old welch's Grape Juice Factory would affect the cyclist. Seeing that image of a drink factory right infront of you but not business has to make them fell like he/she will never make it. These features of the setting had to affect the cyclist.	2.0	3.0		3.0																					
6387	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example he feels dehydrated and tired because he is riding through the desert and has a lack of water. I often feel this way when jogging for extended periods of time. The men in the story “who haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office” also add to the story. Due to their role, the cyclist takes an unmarked shortcut that turns out to be horrible. The Welch’s factory affects the cyclist because it increases his thirst and causes him to once more think about it. The sign showing grape juice looks irrisistable to him and drives him to keep forward in search of anything to drink. The terrain charge also affects the cyclist because it causes him to have to work ever harder to get up hills now rather than just ride flat terrain.	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
6388	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 it says, “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” @CAPS1 the heat the cyclist experienced, since he was in a desert in June, made him dehydrate faster. The heat made him drink more so he ran out of water more quickly. Then he would try and conserve water by not drinking and this would cause him to dehydrate more because he was losing body fluid in sweat secondly, in paragraph @NUM2 it says, ”Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,” These hills affect the cyclist because he would need to use more energy to cycle up the hills. This would cause him to become exhausted more quickly than he would on flat land. If the setting had been different, such as not being in a hilly desert, the cyclist would not have become as dehydrated and tired as he did. In conclusion, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways.	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
6392	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making him tiered, scared, thirsty and cause him to worry. The setting was a hot California day in June and the cyclist was riding through the heat and over the hills and difficult terrain. The cyclist describes the land when he says, “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” He also says, “Over one long, crippling hill.” As the cyclist gets further and further, he has more doubt. Fear and thirst start to get to him. He says, “It didn’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” When the cyclist finds the bait shop he has almost lost all hope. On his way to the shop he says, “Slowly gaining elevation while losing hope.” At the end, the setting makes the cyclist regain his strength as he sees the bait shop, when he sees it, he says, “Then, as easily as rounding a bend, my troubles, thirst and fear were all behind me.” The features of the setting put the cyclist in an unsteady ride of fear, hope and confidence	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
6396	3	When the cyclist first recieves directions to Yosemite Park from the “old timers” he met, he was pretty confident that they knew what they were talking about. To his dismay, these elderly men sent him through life threatening conditions in a deserted area. As the cyclist begins his journey through the hot, June weather, he “rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.'' As he continues forward, he notices that there are no buildings, cars, or people of any kind. He passes abandoned towns and creeps into the desert flat land. The flatland however, morphs into crippling hills with tumbleweeds and snakes awaiting. Not only is the terrain suddenly different, but the cyclist is rapidly deteriorating. Tiredness and lack of water make the cyclist think “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.'' It was amazing that through all this, the cyclist was able to reach a small fishing camp where he is quickly replenished. “Gary and Wilber’s Fish Camp'' saved the cyclist from almost certain death and him to always just use his map.  	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
6405	3	"The features affect the cyclist in a big way. For one the ""heat beating down on him made him sweaty, hot and tired. The heat had also made him thirst which led him to drink a lot of water in a little amount of time so he ran out of water before the next town. Also the fact he was in the desert there were no trees to give time off shade that he could rest in. There were also no people around to help him or give him water. So in the ride he struggled more than he thought he could."	2.0	3.0		3.0																					
6408	3	In the case of thr cyclist in the story, “Do Not Exceed Posted speed limit,” the setting has an enormous affecton the biker. Preclaminatly, the weather causes him to feel dehydrated. He says that he “had been nitting my water bottles pretty regularly. “@CAPS1, he tries to get water from the old well, for the demonsrtrating just how much he needed water. The wate in this pump, the owner said, was, “somewhere in the neighbar had of two hundred degrees. If the water has reached such a high temperature, the reader infe that it must be not outside the author implied nthis when he says he is California in June, it is agarsears day, and the sun was beating down. Another aspect of the setting, the lane, dirty, “ghost town” infested land, had a larse affect on the cycle. As he begins to see how hope. He cannot see any signs of madon life; “there was no one is sight, not a building car or structure of any kind. This empty land make the cyclist himself feel empty. Most literally, the fact that the setting was unknown to the cyclist affected his confusion. He didn’t know the best path to his destination and therefore relied on others for aid. Because of this, he ends up lose and acne.	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
6410	3	"In the short story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. When he arrives in the first “town” that the old men told him to go to, the cyclist “chuckled and moved on”, and acted just sort of indifferrenth, to seeing this old town. As he reached “the fork of sorts” twenty miles up the road, ""the sight was troubling to him his water supply was somewhat deterriorating, so he became a bit uncered. Finally when the cyclist read the sign that said “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, the author continued to move on, but with a large chunk of his confidence gone. He was dehydrated, toned, and had lost a lot of hope after coming across all these places. When he saw the sign for Gary and Wilber’s fish camp, he was as happy as could be, knowing he would drink some water continue his journey the next day, and not listen to old men’s directions again. Many people in stories or in real life are affected by the setting they are in. In the novel @CAPS1 of champions by @PERSON1, one of the characters named @ORGANIZATION1 went on a journey to find an art exhibition, running into many problem's on the way, which in many cases, gave him a lack of hope in reaching his destination safely."	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
6417	3	In the essay intitled “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not exceed the speed limit” the setting changes as so does the mood of @NUM1 essay as well as the mood of the cyclist. For example towards the begining of the essay, at the reserve the essay states, “At a resevoir campground outside of Lodi, California, I enjoyed the serenity of an early summer evening.” This shows how towards the begining of the essay the cyclist is happy, just woke up and getting reading to go on a nice bike ride; however this all changes when he gets directions from a cople of “old-timers.” From that point on his trip goes down hill and the essay states, “About forty miles in to the pedal, I arrived at the first “town”, a ghost town,” “The sun was beginning to heat down,” This also shows the the setting of a ghost town and a setting with the sun beating down is effecting the mood of the essay and the mood of the cyclist as well as when he goes another @NUM2 miles to a different ghost town with only a few rusty water pumps containing acid flavored water. At this point cyclist is very worried because its hot and he has no water, while knowing he has another @NUM3 miles to go. @NUM3 miles of rolling hills and hot sun shile seeing a “A Rough Road Ahead” sign and a diamondback snake he is sure he is going to die. However it all changes when a different sign, one for a baitshop. This is how the author, Joe Kurmaskie uses the setting to effect the mood.	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
6419	3	As the cyclist continues on his ride, changes begin to occur in the surroundings, which ultimately affects the cyclist’s attitude. When first starting out on his journey to Yosemite, the cyclist started out that morning, “with strong legs and a smile on my face”. He had received information from a few of the older locals that would help to cut the amount of time it took to arrive at Yosemite National Park. However, as he was riding, the cyclist realized that perhaps the older men’s travel advice was a little out dated. with barely any water left to hydrate himself, and being surrounded by nothing but more road and desert, the cyclist couldn’t help but laugh. “It was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself. “At this point, the cyclist was mad at himself for not just using the map that he had brought with him instead of listening to the locals. Although the cyclist remained determined to find water, he had begun to lose hope when he suddenly came across a bait store. Here he was able to rehydrate himself, and with his renewed spirit, continued on his journey, this time using his map.	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
6423	3	The setting of the story affected the cyclist by changing his mood. At the strat he had can eidance which died once he got into the barren dessert but picked up when  he round a rest stop.

6441	3	"In the story “Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" the features of the setting affect the cyclist, it say this because the cyclist enables us of what is going around him and he feels about it. It says, “one ramshack shed, several rusty pumps and a coral that couldn’t hold the lamest mule greated me. The author goes on to say that it troubled him. Actually that made the author scared that maybe he was all alone in the desert with ghost town. The unplanned that the roads were rusty where the speed limit was 55 mph since he barely had any water he was going 12 mph. This tells me, he’s troubled and confused about the surrounding ways, because it all desert seem light it became the author is slowly loosing hope on the travels further and further. I think it’s the same week people that as soon as trouble comes; or looks like it’s among they start losing hope and their better judgment, and life seems a lot harder."	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
6444	3	The setting plays an important part in the authors mood. When the author finds the dilapidated ghost town, he is still high spirited and amused. He thinks that it is a little funny that the old men’s “town” was now abandoned. “…(the town) fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. I chuckled…” This shows that the author is still in good spirits because he can still laugh. When “a tar like substance  oozed out of the water pump at the next stop the author became a little unsettled, as the author was running low on water. But he was still optomistic. Once the rolling expansive hills came into view, the author  let out a “sad, hopeless laugh.” The author was depressed , dehydrated and had all but given up , however he kept going and eventually made it to some water.	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
6445	3	In the passage “Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Speed Limit” the setting must definetly affects the cyclist. When the cyclist comes for the first abandured “town” he searches for water but finds only that which tastes like battery acid “when I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid.” The makes his dehydration seem much worse because of the fact that he has water it is just undrinkable. The rough road ahead there gives the feeling of determination because when the cyclist in on his last legs he must work even harder to get water a flat road was replaced by short rolling hills,” this quote shows that despite his condition the cyclist most perservere. Also quote “tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridicuosly large snake –“tumble weeds and snakes give the feeling of desolation and of being alone, which is what the cyclist is this point. The setting of this story directly correalates with how the cyclist is feeling.	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
6446	3	The hot day in June riding a bike in the desert. The cyclist rode off into the sun on his way to Yosemite National Park. The old men told him where to go on the map even though they had not been through that way in years. When the cyclist started his day off ready to go. He thought he would be able to stop and get water regulary but as he found out he was in the middle of the desert with no water around. The man pushed himself and stopped thinking about water. He even put pebbles in his mouth to suck on so he would be able to keep his mind off water. The man was very smart in this situation and knew what to do. This experence has made him stronger.	2.0	3.0		3.0																					
6455	3	"The features of the setting, or environment, in which the cyclist is in greatly affects him. First of all, after leaving the campground with directions from the older gentlemen, he enters an area that is greatly isolated. In paragraph @NUM1, he wrote, ""This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time but on @TIME1, it fit the traditonal definition of a ghost town. ""This state of being alone later affected the cyclist because his increasing dehydration was becoming dangerous; if he were to collapse, he would most likely die. This drove the cyclist to continue on in order to survive. Another aspect that affected him was the extremely hot temperature. In paragraph, he implies the weather is hot by telling the reader he is traveling through to California desert in June. The heat gives the cyclist another obstacle to overcome in his struggling to get to the next town for water. Lastly in paragraph @NUM2, he mention the terrain changes to gently rolling hills. This shows the physical and metaphorical obstacles must get over the heat and isolation, but must also find the mental drive and determination to carry on. "	2.0	3.0		3.0																					
6462	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The cyclist should had looked at his map instead of taking the old man advise because all the information was on the map.

If the cyclist was in a car mabey he would have better luck because he would be going  faster than the @NUM1 bike.	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
6463	3	Many things on the cyclist journey affected him. It was in the middle of summer in California. The heat is unbeleivable and rediculously hot. “… I could drop from heatstroke…” he was so bad overheated and dyhdrated that he could of died any minute. He could have also been killed by a giant snake. “…look like a diamondback- blocked the majority of the pavement…” It could have easily killed him, if he wasn’t careful.

6472	3	In the essay “Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” The features of the setting had a great affect on the hard-working cyclist. The weather land and surrounding objects really determined the cyclists mood and ability. One example would be the statement, “cool pines, rushing rivers of upsemite had my name written all over them.”The refreshing nature and cool air made the cyclist feel confident energized and ready. Another example would be the quote, “One ramshackleshed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest Mule greet me.”there, the cyclist feels troubled and alittle curious as to what lay ahead this water wasn't not the best and he was worried. The last example was, “flat road was replaced by short rolling hills...tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake.” there, the cyclist tries to stay focused through distractions. It is deserted and he feels dehydrated as well. As his route ends he comes across in manymore aspects of the setting which create a different feeling or ability. Therefore the nature of where his bike passed, and the things he saw affected his choices and ability.	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
6476	3	The setting effects the cyclist in many ways. And following old timers advice wasn't too smart of him. In that essay he was headed to the Yosemite National Park, he had a map to follow and he trusted himself, he a cyclist he knows his way around. But came around a couple of men who told him a shortcut. He trusted them which he shouldn't have and he was on his way. The setting was rough. He was riding through a California desert; which was probably way too not, and he was looking water. The only thing that he found tasted live battery and so that no good for him. It was a flat land, than rolling hills. The next town would have been in the @NUM1 miles. This cyclist was hilling himself. While riding along these lands there was more in sight, and no building or cars it was line a dead road. Those old men had him through neck and been, once he made it to the next town he knew with those conditions	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
6478	3	The features of the setting including vast emptiness, hills, heat, and no water all create obstacles for the cyclist in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” @CAPS1 to the vast emptiness of the area in which he was traveling he could not stop somewhere to ask for help or to take a rest. Also there were no other travelers so he could not ask for assistance from them. Another obstacle during his trip are the hills. It takes more energy to pedal up hill so he ends up tiring easily and taking longer than expected. There is also extreme heat which causes him to sweat and even become even more thirsty. So he ends up running out of water. In the story he writes, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” He is now becoming thirsty and if he doesn’t find water he @MONTH1 dehydrate. He searches for a place to rest where there @MONTH1 be water but he is not able to. All of these obstacles cause the cyclist to become devastated and give up hope but he continues his travel and eventually finds a place to rest. All of these obstacles tying into another.	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
6483	3	There were a few features in the setting that affected the cyclist. One very important feature is that the cyclist was in the desert. This is demonstrated by the statement “I was travelling through the high deserts of California.” not only was the cyclist in the desert, he was there in June, one of the hottest months of the year. It is demonstrated that he was there in June reading to the statement “I was travelling in June.” @CAPS1 there at that time made dehydration a bigger risk. It was also very hot there. We know this because when he was at the water pump, he stated, “blackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” From this, we can affirm that not only was at hot, the water was dirty. The water also “had the flavor of battery acid.” This was bad for the cyclist who was running low on water because he “had been hitting (his) water bottles pretty regularly.” The fact that he had little water left is demonstrated in the statement, “The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips.” The cyclist was in a bad situation. These had ganged-up against him in his trip. These features are the desert, the high temperatures, and the blackish water which tasted like battery acid. The fact that he was low on water made it harder to fight these features with water, he would battle the desert, high temperatures, and have no need to pump bad water. Again, the features of the setting that affected the cyclist are the desert, the high temperatures, and the bad water which he could not drink.	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
6484	3	In the story “Rough Road Ahead” the cyclist was excited and determined to get to Yosemite National Park. The cyclist had to be thinking of the beautiful waters with “His name written over them”. The rough terrain and harsh weather took its affection on the unaware cyclist. The sun, beat down on the cyclist back, he tried to ignore it, but soon the heat made him frequently drink his water away to sips to drink. The cyclist was told by the old man a town was only @NUM1 miles aways. The town was the traditional definition of a ghost town. “That probably gave the cyclist no hope for surviving of finding anyone to help him reach his destination. The conditions of the roads, the lack of water which made him see a mirage, made the cyclist not trust the words of an old man who had led him to the abandon locations he had seen. The cyclist was affected by the settings in a bad way but in the end was given a little help from a traditional map.	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
6485	3	In the essay, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affected the cyclist because it made it more difficult for the cyclist to survive and make it through his journey. In the essay, it says, “I arrived at the first “Town”…this place might have been a thriving little spot at one time…but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost @NUM1). In the essay, the cyclist takes directions from a few old men to get to Yosemite National Park. The cyclist has a limited amount of water, and it was a very humid day for traveling. Because of the humidity, the cyclist nearly ran out of water when he had to cycle up, “short, rolling hills” (@NUM2) in the hot weather. Had the town been thriving, he could have bought more water to make his trip easier to accomplish. Also, if the road in the story would have been flat, he cyclist wouldn’t have gotten as tired as he did and needed more water. It would have been less strainful on the cyclist to pedal on a flat road rather than a hilly road. The challenges facing the cyclist remined me of that of the main character of the movie @PERSON2. In this movie, the main character must make his way through the extreme conditions of the desert, just like the cyclist had to in order to reach his destination. In conclusion, the setting clearly affects the cyclist’s journey in a negative way.	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
6487	3	In the selection “Do not exceed posted speed limit” there are a lot of great details of the area around the cyclist. In the text, it makes it clear that the route the cyclist is traveling is very deserted when the drinking water was explained as oozing out and tasting like battery acid, you can tell that people hadn’t been there in awhile. Also, being informed that he was traveling through a desert, in June. I am able to understand how thirsty he is. Also, he is traveling for miles over a rough terrain and “crippling hills,” according to the text, so he has to be ovely exhausted. I could understand why he was so upset with getting wrong directions based on the troubles he encounters when he finally reaches the camp and drinks water, you too are glad he has reached somewhere that wasn’t empty and deserted.	2.0	3.0		3.0																					
6491	3	The towns, the terrain, the Welch’s Grape Juice factory- all are parts of the setting that affect the cyclist. “This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time- say, before the last world war,” describes the cyclist, “but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.” The town intensifies the cyclist feeling of doubt, in that it is increasing. At this part, he is really regretting taking the old guy's advice in taking the “shortcut.” “Not two miles into the next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing,” reveals the cyclist. The cyclist is already very worried and very doubtful, and the terrain is making it worse it mirrors the town in which the cyclist had stopped at earlier to, again make his feeling of doubt increase. The cyclist exclaims, “ By the looks of it- had been a Welch’s Grape Juice Factory.” The cyclist gets very excited when he sees this, and gets a great feeling of hope. So throughout the whole story, the setting of where the cyclist is at affects his mood by giving him doubt, but by also giving him hope.  	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
6494	3	Many things caneffect a cyclist and how they ride, in this essay many things effected him such as the setting of the story. One of the problems of the setting was there were no stores or even people, another and most important thing was the lack of water around him, so many things can effect a cyclist while They are riding inculding there suriondings.	2.0	3.0		3.0																					
6505	3	As soon as the cyclist gained information about which way to go, he set off through tall, cool pines. They  gave him a feeling of confidence, and physically cooled his body down. As he headed down the road, he encountered various small towns-none of which looked promising- which gave him a feeling of despair, in accordance to his lack of water. Even further  into. the journey, he found one last town, and arundown welche’s  @CAPS1 factory. This increased his thirst and gave him a feeling of spite towards the old men who had given him advice. However, he soon found a bait house where he could get water and escape the heat. For this he was satisfied and grateful to the owner. It made him realize to never again trust the old men.	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
6507	3	The features of the setting affect the authors dispotion as well as his ability to complete the journey, thus creating an obstacle the author must overcome. At the end of the paragraph five the author writes that “I was traveling through the high deserts of California.” This setting is important because it adds a sense of urgency to his trip when he starts to run low on water. This is similair to when I was backpacking and a bear got most of our food. Our normal backpacking trip had become more of a game of survival. So, the water issue was clearly the main point of of conflict that the author presented in the setting. He also writes that “Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” This aspect of the setting also affects the cyclist because it makes it much harder for him to progress than if it was a downhill road. In short, the setting of the story presents the main points of conflict to the author and thus was essential to the essay.	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
6512	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. He is riding in the desert where there is low to rain. This means that he can’t collect any water to drink if he runs out. Also, deserts are hot. The heat will speed up the dehydration process so he will need more water to survive. If he runs out of water, he will die. The cyclist finds a building, but it is abandoned and empty. All these features of the setting affect him. Since he can‘t find water, he has to conserve what he has. Also, the heat is killing him. It doesn’t help to have an abandoned building be the only one he finds. During the whole time that there is death in the air, the desert with nothing growing, no water, the cyclist is thinking about his death. As long as he thinks about his death, there is only more death. As soon as he puts the pebbles in his mouth to stop thinking about death and being thirsty, he sees a bait shop which saves his life. He thought about his surviving, and immediately found a shop to and he could drink.	2.0	3.0		3.0																					
6516	3	"The setting affects the cyclist because the cyclist believes that he has a nice, short, flat distance to travel to get to Yosemite but instead it is a long, hilly(rough),  hot journey. He only prepared himself for a quick ride, bringing only enough water for that ride, and wasn’t prepared for the reality of his ride. First of all he is riding in the middle of the day (the hottest part) in the “high deserts of colifornia in June” I know when I go to camp here in @LOCATION1 during the summer I drink I drink six to seven liters, but the author only mentions a ""few bottles of water"" which aren't going to help him in that heat. Secondly, the cyclist believed that the old men had given him a safe path to follow but instead he came across a “ridiculously large snake. It really looked like a diamond back” That is a poisonous snake and the cyclist has barely able to “ease post” it because, of his lack of water. Lastly, the cyclist expected the old men to give him an easy path on a flat terrain when in fact it was “replaced by short, rolling hills” which means you have to put more effort (using more water) to climb the hills. The setting definetely affects the cyclist because it makes it more difficult for him to reach his destination but without a few bumps in the road, how is he to learn a life lesson?"	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
6530	3	The setting of this story is very rigurous. At the begining of the story the boy was fine. He had a bottle of water with him so that he didn’t get dehydrated. When he was riding he started to feel the sun get higher into the sky, though he could barely feel. It because of the pines that caused the road, and the cool feel of the river. The cyclist got to the second town on his journey and he had been drinking his water all day and was about out. He had found a water pump. He got down on his knees and palled with his night hot all that came but was blackish water. He just feared the water and stated that it tasted like battery acid. He began to ride again. Not two miles up the road the terrain changed. Not only was it rolling hills, it was also getting hotter. He was majorly dehydrated because he was out of water except nor a few “tantalizing sips. Dry sweat circled his shirt and he was afraid he could froz up heatstrokes. Where he was at was in the middle of no where, with no buildings, cars or structures in sight. Over were of the hills he saw a building came in no view. He wiped the sweat off his eyes so makee sure it was not a malinge,” By the lols of it had been a Welch’s @CAPS1 @CAPS2 Factory.” He is a dehydrated and tired that he could see a “Young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice in his mouth.” There is only the problems it is abandoned. This person was imagining things. He got back on his bike and stuck pebbles into mouth. This was to help tabe his mind off being thirst.	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
6532	3	In the essay “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. First, the sun is making the cyclist hot and dehydrated. He states “The sun was beginning to beat down,” @CAPS1, the sun was a big factor on the affect on the cyclist. Also, the hills of the country roads. Going up and down hills take alot of work you have to use alot of energy. The cyclist says “@CAPS2 were replaced by short, rolling hills.” @CAPS3, there were snakes in the road, which make the cyclist timid looking out for snakes so he would not get bit. Againg the cyclist states “dimond back-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.” @CAPS4, there was an old factory that gave the cyclist hope and then crushed his hopes. The factory even made him more thirsty. @CAPS1, there were many affects on the cyclist due to the setting.	2.0	3.0		3.0																					
6543	3	The cyclist in the essay, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” is about a great adventure gone bad. He has every thing he needs but some how it turns out bad. He get low on water & the setting is horrible. He is on his way from a camp ground in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1 to the Yosemite river. He gets bad directions from old guys at the camps ground. On his way he ran into two abandon towns & was running out of water then he came to a sign that said, “Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” He was pedeling over hills & becoming dehydrated when he tought he was going to die he came to a bait shop & got waiter & met an old guy who was going to give him direction & he decided he better stick to the map.

6554	3	The setting of “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” affect the cyclist so many ways. First of all, the cyclist is riding in a desert, in mid- June, with the heat “beginning to beat down” on him. This feature of the setting causes the cyclist to drink more water, but when his supply of water was running low, he was unable to drink much water to hydrate himself. The cyclist began to realize that he “could trap from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.” @CAPS1, the long distance and changes in the terrain that the cyclist was travelling, affected him. The distance on which to cyclist was travelling to Yosemite National Park, consisted of hours and miles of riding. Over vast changes of terrain. The “flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills”, which affected the cyclist speed and energy to finish his trip.	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
6563	3	The features of the setting have a big impact on the cyclist. One feature is the hot weather and area he is in. He says he is in the “high desserts of California in June.” @CAPS1 being hot in @CAPS2, it has cyclist is around deserts, causing more heat. “I could drop from a heatstroke,” he says. Being hot from the sun beating down on him took away the cyclist’s energy he needs for riding his bike. Another feature that affected the cyclist was his lack of water. “Trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” This affected the cyclist by making him tired. Being tired from no water, the cyclist had trouble going up hills on his bike. The last feature that affected the cyclist was all of the hills in his road. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” These hills made it hard to go up on a bike, considering his lack of water, and the heat. All of these features affect the cyclist by making him lose energy and get tired and frustarated because of their negative impact.	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
6564	3	Nature has an affect on everyone, even when they don’t think it does. Expecially for cyclist traveling anywhere or everywhere. In “Do not exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie is a perfect example about settings laffect people like cyclist. When you’re riding your bike as actually cross country transportation, you have to know what your doing and where you’re going. The cyclist in this story decided to take advice from older fellows and ends up going the wrong route for a cyclist because at these “town” they had no water, because they weren’t towns to begin with, not anymore atleast. If you don’t have any water like this guy did hills could kill you. And in any case, you have to know what to do for example.” l gathered a few pebbles and struck them in my mouth. I’d read once that sucking on stones help take your mind off thrist” This guy knew a little bit of survival tips. If he’d gone all that way without standing up yo his thrist and those hills, he probably would have had some kind of stroke. That is just a few way that setting could harm you.  	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
6566	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many was. First, the “town” The cyclist first comes upon is described as a ghost town. Although the cyclist chuckles about it, this setting sets up the long journey the cyclist has a head of him. There were other features that would negatively affect the cyclist. For example, “…I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” (pg @NUM1). Flat land is much easier for a cyclist to pedal on. The change from flat land to hills affected his stamena and will to keep going. He really had to push himself to trudge up and down each hill. His determination finally led him to, “Gary and Wilber’s Fish camp…” (pg @NUM2). He finally found hope.   	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
6572	3	Many features of the setting affected the cyclist. First, the heat was the main part of nature that threw him off. It caused him to go dehiderated because lack of water and he went kind of dilerious. He thought he was seeing things and his vision was distorted. Next, the water he had to come across in the pump was un drinkable because of the tarlike substance coming out of it and the degree of water he said it was, which was @NUM1 degree. Lastly, the Welch’s factory that he came across was teasing him in in the way that he couldn’t have the liquids he needed and the little boy advertised on the building was drinking his refreshed Welch’s juice. Not only did the cyclist get off track because the directions, the setting made his bike adventure to Yosemite even more unbearable.	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
6575	3	The setting affects the cyclist in almost everything he does and everything he faces. The setting is a hot day in June in the dessert. There are many hills and the terrain changes a few times. Because the day is hot the cyclist drinks lots of water. And because he drinks lots of water he very soon runs out. In the story it states, “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high desserts of California in June. This quote shows that because it was so hot, the cyclist drank lots of water and because he drank lots of water he very quickly run out of water. Also in the story it states, “Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.” This quote suggests that becaused the terrain changed to hills, the cyclist became very tired and hot from having to pedal up and down those hills. And because this caused him become hot and tired he also drank his water more quickly than if he was pedaling on a flat paved road in a cool day in @DATE1. In conclusion the setting causes the cyclist to become tired, hot, and thirsty, which affects his entire journey.	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
6578	3	The conditions for the cyclist in the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” are pretty dangerous. “a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement balance my dehydrated state bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips” (kurmaskie, @NUM1). There was a rather large snake in his path. You can tell he isn’t an expert on snakes because he couldn’t identify it. Because he is in the desert on a long bike ride, he is dehydrated. His water supply is almost gone. The cyclist feared many dangerous challenges in his journey.	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
6584	3	In “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by @PERSON1, the features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist. The first major example is when the cyclist finds that the flat road is turning into “short, rolling hills,” These hills are increasing the difficulty and are causing him doubt that he will make it. An additional part of the setting which caused major doubt was that he was in a deserted desert. “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” The horizon was what kept cyclist going. “I began breaking the ride down into distarres: I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, I’d be fine.’ The horizon kept him hopeful and determined. Without the setting he would not have been in such a serious but luckily in the end the setting helped him be determined enough to make it.	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
6592	3	Many of the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The cyclist is biking through deserts. “A rediculously large snake” this quote shows that only is weather and climate agasint him but also nature.” I could drop from heat stroke” another great quote showing how hot it really is where the cyclist is.” There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” A great detailed desciption of where the cyclist is and how deserted the area is.” The bottle only contained a few  tantilising sips.” This cyclist is low on water in the desert and in the desert with no water that could be a very bad thing. The above quotes really draw you in and you get to see the many features of the setting and what its like for the cyclist.	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
6597	3	In many real-life situations, nature or a setting can be the biggest hindrance in succeeding, or even surviving. For example, the cyclist with stood the blozing heat of the sun as he pedaled through what seemed to be the @CAPS1’s living room: Dry, desolate, and extremely scornful. “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from a heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June.” @CAPS2 and depicts the intense heats of the desert. Another feature in the setting was the every hanging hills and steps though pedaling down the hills was an easier task, traveling up the hill, as well  as maneuvering the thirsts and bends served as a direct conflict. An example, “with what I believed was my last burst of energy I maneuvered a setting affect a situation is ultimately, the cyclist reached his destination is great relief. But the biggest hindrance was along his setting.                        	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
6599	3	First, by accepting the old mens’ advice, the cyclist was setting himself up for some hardships that he would, easily have avoided by using his map. He first encounters a “ghost town”, lifeless and most importantly, waterless. Then, he encounters a pump that gives out water tasting like “battery acid”. Next he rides past a “Rough Road Ahead” sign; not the most encouraging thing on his journey. To add to the despair, he has to manever his way past a tempting yet empty juice factory. Finally, the parched cyclist arrives at “Gary and Wilber’s Fish Camp. “To him, this simple bait shop was like  beacon of hope from food himself.	2.0	3.0		3.0																					
6600	3	In this story, the cyclist was trying to make it to Yosemite, California. In the begining, the cyclist was sure of himself he decided to ask some old men that looked like they haven't been off their porch since Carter was in office for directions. The old men ended up leading him into the middle of the desert. In the desert, the sun was beating down on him and he had a limited supply of water. There was no sign of civilization what so ever. These hot conditions made the cyclist very hot, tired, and very thirsty. But that didn't stop him, he kept going and eventually he came apon a little town where he could drink cool water and take a well needed rest. 	2.0	3.0		3.0																					
6615	3	The cyclist and his journey in Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed limit were impacted by the setting. The “deserts of California in June” caused him to be weary very easily. The terrain change from the flat road to hills made him feel less confident because he felt the road sign was taunting him by saying DO NOT Exceed 55 mph. He could only go @NUM1. Finally, the large snake created an obstacle for him by blocking the majority of pavement in front of the cyclist. All of these features affected the cyclist in some way.	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
6619	3	I think that there were many things contributing to the cyclists state at the end of the story. First, there was the fact of time. He was cycling in June which is very hot due to it is summer. Second, he was cycling through California which is warm even in early @DATE1. And third he was traveling through the deserts. So if you put all of that together. He was cycling on a hot June day in the deserts of California. These @NUM1 things all contributed to the characters state. He went through dead towns in his search for water and found an old well pump with extremely hot water, that tasted like battery acid. He drank to much water at the begining which left him with just spit toward the end. He was lucky to find a fish camp in the middle of nowhere and to have found water. The three things made him drink too much water at first and barely left him with enough.	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
6633	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways.For example, ""I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" This quote shows that his surroundings were giving him diffuculty and a challenge for his travel. By describing the hills as ""rolling"" it helps the reader imagine the obstacles he was going through. Also, the sign that read, ""Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit."" gives the reader a feeling that the character is in danger. Lastly an example of the setting that helps shows the charcters hardships is, ""no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any hand."" If anything were to the happen to the character, as the author was foreshadowing, he'd be stranded and all alone to die. He'd be in trouble and there would be no one to help him. If the author did not use these examples, the reader would not easily get a picture of the troubles he had to overcome. In conclusion these examples added emphasise and meaning to the text.   "	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
6636	3	The features of the setting gradually contribute to the cyclist’s anger. For example, at the beginning of the story, the cyclist comes across poisonous snakes, “one ramshacke shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mule.” All of sights trouble the narrator, and he starts to becom frightened and neurotic. As he cycles on, the narrator begins to deplete his water supply, and when he stops to restock, “the water wouldn’t cool down” and “it had the flavor of battery acid. The cyclist’s lack of water frustrates him, and the increasing steepness of the hills adds to his annoyance. The final straw came when the cyclist passed by what he thought “had been a Welch’s Grape Juice Factory.” The narrator goes on in an outrage to explain that hopes to die out on the road, in order to spare himself from the dreaded features of the setting.  	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
6637	3	The features in the setting most definetly affect the cyclist while he travels. The cyclist is incredibly thirsty and tired and the setting he’s placed in just gives him no hope of survival really. He first comes to a “ghost town” where he finds no one is living. This first encounter with isolation in a desolute place doesn’t really affect him because it is the first place he finds but the rest of the storys setting comes to mimic this. As he travels he is met with barren land, no water and no people in sight. It’s June in California and the cyclist fears he @MONTH1 soon suffer from heat stroke if he doesn’t find water yet. It doesn’t help when he comes to an abandoned juice factory that taunts him with the one thing he needs to survive. All in all the features in the setting make the cyclist lose hope, make him feel like he will die if he dosen’t find water.	2.0	3.0		3.0																					
6645	3	The setting in this story greatly affects the cyclist. It is an extremely hot now in California while the narrator in aiding his ride. This causes him to become delighted much faster while he is on a “Short hit” leading to no where. ”Wide signs of dried outcast winded my limb, and the growing realization that I could drop from ?? a gorgeous day in June” This gust shows how that calm day really was and the fact the cyclist is sweating so much shows how much the weather is affecting him. The rolling hills in the story also affect the cyclist. By cycling towards up and down no often, it secured his journey. It cowed him to the side even longer in getting to a town with water.The deserted knowns in the setting are negatively also affected the narrator. It gave him a hopeless narration because there was no place to stop and depleting his water supply.	2.0	3.0		3.0																					
6646	3	Joe Kurmaskie had a rough time trying to get to Yosemite National park. First, he received directions from an old man, Joe followed these instructions; little did he know that he would be headed for many hardships. After he reached the first town he checked his supply. About @NUM1 more miles he reliced his bottle was getting low because he was travelling through the high deserts of California. It is hot cool out there,then the terrain changed. He no longer had that much water. He ran into a snake, which he swore was a alamond back. Finally, he came to another town, got some water and then left after going through ghost towns. Riding in conditions that are hot and unfamiliar are hard to do. Adding hills to heat is not a good combination, with nothing around val it can be very dangerais, even fatal. Before you bike thinkof what conditions are ahead of you	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
6651	3	The features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist. First of all he is travelling through a desert in California in June so the weather is extremely hot and the cyclist needs water, however as he is running out of the water he brought along with himself, he cannot find any other water himself so he is thirsty and almost dehydrated. Also, if frustrates him that when he finds water, not only is it hot it tastes like battery acid @CAPS1, when the cyclist decides to conserve some of his water and go to the next town to get more water, but there is another setback. The condition of the road is so poor, that the cyclist cannot go more that 12 mph. Thus, if he ever reaches the next town. he still will have to wait longer for the much needed water, travelling at 12 mph. The snake is also another setback that the cyclist was fortunately able to escape. Thus his major concern is the lack of water.	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
6655	3	The cyclist was affected by the fact that he took advice from some old men who’s information was not accurate. Then he cycled along the desert which was very hot. He had a limited supply of water and that also affected him in a very bad way. He almost had a heat stroke a few times. He was probably angry that he took these men’s advice and got himself into this. Then when he found the fish camp, he was overjoyed with relief. But at the same time, if he had asked someone else for directions, he would not have been in this situation in the first place. So it’s really confusing because he probably felt relived and mad at the same time. And then the other old man asked him did he know the best way there. He was right to say yes because if he didn’t, the old man would have gave him some more messed up direction and he would have been out there again, about to have another heat stroke.	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
6657	3	"In the short story Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit it is shown that the features of the setting do affect the cyclist through the story. In the story the cyclist is faced with the mental and physical journey he takes while riding his bike. Being unware of where he is on his journey the setting begins to really affect him. For example as he keeps making his journey he is affected by the old towns and desert places he even says that ""The sight was troubling."" As he continues to California in June the heat and the long journey really began to affect him both mentally and physically. For example he says, ""I got down my hands and knew working the hands of the rusted water pump with all my strength."" The quote shows because he is biking so long is looking water and there is not a town is sight he becomes weak and although he is at terminated to make it through this journey he is becoming more hopeless and sorry for himself because of the setting he is placed in.

6661	3	In the essay, the cyclist is greatly affected by the features of the setting. Under the conditions he could barely survive and make it to his destination. It is clear that the features of the setting are affecting him when he states,“The speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph. Sometimes life can be so cruel.” In his efforts he is slowly getting weaker and the sign he sees only makes him feel worse because it seems to him that it mocking him. He also states, “I’d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you had left to circulate. With any luck I’d hit a bump and ledge one in my throat.” This shows he is ready to give up completely and wouldn’t care if he died. From the author’s tone, it is clear that the features of the setting do affect the cyclist.	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
6669	3	In the story “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, written by Joe Kurmaskie, the author describes the setting as hot, tiresome, and aqusting. You get this picture from the author when the bikerider is describing his surroundings. The bikerider describes his as the high desserts of California in June, being hot and musky, ruff terrain, etc. This gives you an image of what the bike rider feels physically and emotionally. This image shows how tired, thirsty, and determined the bikerider really is. Using words, metaphors, and imagery the author puts you in the shoes of the bikerider emotionally and physically.	3.0	0.0		3.0																					
6672	3	Varias faetures of the setting affect the journey and mooble if the cyclist in the text. The first feature of the setting that affect the cyclist is the desert. He is “traveling through the high deserts of California in June” , and this is making him really thirsty. “[He] had been hitting [his] water bottles pretty regularly “because of this. He later runs out of water, and becomes hopeless. He becomes hopelee because there is no building or establishments anywere in sight. Therefore no water and there isn’t a place to get any water. Another feature of the setting that affects him is the people that gave him directions. They told him abait a shoutcut, and he listened. This through everything off, and he was left with despair. Another feature is the Gary and Wilber’s fish camp.This lead him to sicocss of finding water. This affected his mood because he had hope again.

6677	3	In the essay, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting had a major impact on the character. The cyclist was trying to get to Yosemite National Park, but on the way, he had some troubles, the fact that there was not much civilization affected the cyclist because he was not able to refill his water bottles, so he grew very thirsty. Also, the many hills and the fact that it is summer impacted him greatly because he became tired out more easily and could not pedal as fast. When it says, “A tar like substance oozed out Wouldn’t cool down,” it showed how he wasn’t able to drink. Also, when he passed the grape juice factory, it must have been torture to him since he was so thirsty. If he hadn’t taken the advice of the men in the first place he would have had a much shorter ride and would not have been so exhausted. The setting affected the cyclist a lot in this essay.	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
6680	3	The features of the setting in the story “DO Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, affect the cyclist in the story, in many ways. The first of which would definetly be the lack of water the cyclist had, and the fact that there wasn’t anywhere around for miles. From the text it read “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” This evidence from the text proves to the reader that the cyclist was getting worried. Another part of the setting would be the obvious element of temperature. The cyclist is our in the hot, relentless desert. “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.” The author here, by using the elements of nature, is trying to make the reader concerned/scared for the main character. The final key had to travel and the road conditions. Although the desert is flat, he began to notice some hills in the road, and such a long distance, including the heat, could be deadly. The setting’s elements, greatly effect the cyclist in this story.	2.0	3.0		3.0																					
6682	3	"The lone biker in “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit” by @PERSON1 is strongly affected by the features of the landscape. The sun is the most important factor; it drives him to first consume his water quickly, and then drives him search for a water source.”The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it...I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly,” in this quote, it reveals that even though the biker had not acknowledged the sun, his body had required water, depleting his supply in his water bottles. A lack of water feeling two hundred degrees...it had the flavor of battery acid."" The only water that the bike is able to find is not consumable. The most important of the factors, in the matter of survival, is the fish camp that the biker finally reaches. ”I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink.” The biker had been on the brink of dehydration and the fish camp is where he finally reganed the strength to continue on his journey."	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
6686	3	Different settings can effect how well your bycycle ride goes. If it is hot and you have lots of hills it makes it hard. If you have no hills and it is a sunny breezy day it makes it nice to ride. In the essay the biker had no water left but was going down a hill. The going down the hill part was probably easy but the fact that he had no water left was not a good thing.	2.0	3.0		3.0

6694	3	The different settings in the essay/ writing affect the cyclist because of how old and hopeless they look. I think this because when the cyclist stops at the first town, he’s looking around expecting to find a quaint, bustling little place, but instead he finds these abandoned, decimated old houses. And if you yourself can picture being in his situation, then you can imagine how discouraging and almost frightening that must be. As the cyclist continues for a few more miles, he’s becoming slowly dehydrated, and finally sees a building. At first, he thinks this building is a mirage; he was wrong, but for him in this situation it was worse- an old juice factory, right when point you kind of get the feeling that every things turning against you and that there’s no hope left. But when he finds the fishing camp, his entire perspective of things changes, and he just feels so thankful to have been saved.	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
6696	3	"It can’t be known as, ""easy"" to ride through a desert on a bike. Adding rough pavement, rusty water pumps, and not so friendly animals adds to the discomfort as well. The cyclist in this story encountered all these things, making his supposedly pleasurable ride turn to a semi brutal experience “it got down on my hands and knee, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength. Alike substance ooed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees, “This quote shows how the conditions of his water supply where, which eventually lead him to dehydration. It lead: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT @CAPS1 SPEED LIMIT.”This quote also shows how the riding conditions were making the  cyclist have a harder time keeping speed. “at some point tumberweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake-it really did look like a diamond back-beaked the majority of the pavement in front of me.” @CAPS2, this quote show of some of the dangers the  cyclist encountered.

From this quote; “a ton-like substance oozed out.” This quote shows how after @NUM1 miles of pedaling when he was supposed to have come to two towns by that point his one chance of water had been depleated. The next time the setting affect is used is when he comes for a building that was rusted out.

6701	3	During the cyclist’s biking adventure he encounters several interesting situations. Each experience is in response to the setting in which it takes place. For example, this young man starts out confident with a bright hope of eventually reaching Yosemite National Park. The first spot he comes to is a ghost town This sight doesn’t immediately affect him, however it greatly adds on to the long term effects. He decides to continue on his treck reaching the next ghost from at this time he is becoming dehedrated due to his lack of water supply He decides to keep persueing his good and figures there must be water up ahead in the next town. In order to get the next town he must encounter some precarious situations including some changes in terrain.

The different settings greatly affected his nature of confidence.	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
6705	3	The features of the setting in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” affect the cyclist. For example, the tough terrain made it very difficult for the cyclist to reach his destination, Yosemite. He was already very fatigued but had to overcome hills. In the essay, he states, “I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. The setting features also affected the cyclist when he encountered the snake. He was dehydrated and could barely navigate around the dangerous snake. The cyclist explains, “At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a riduculously large snake, it really did look like a diamondback-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased fast, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. The setting also affected the cyclist because there was no one around him to help. The cyclist describes, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” The cyclist was all alone and had to rely on himself to make it to Yosemite. In conclusion, the features of the setting in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” affect the cyclist. He had to overcome ruggid terrain without energy, avoid a diamondback snake, and make it all the way to Yosemite because there was no one around. As you can see, the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
6707	3	The harsh features at the setting affect the cyclist by hindering his journey to Yosemite National Park. As the cyclist is traveling along “The high deserts of California in June”, some problems arise. The heat from the pounding sun in the desert takes a toll on the cyclist causing him to drink more water and rapidly deplet his supply. The cyclist is also traveling through small “gost towns” rather than stoping at appropriate rest stops in order to refill with water and relax etc. Also while refilling he encounters hazards such as “Short rolling hills” through ghost the terrain and ever a snake. All of these features in the setting impare the cyclists ability to maintain confidence in wether he will make it to his destination and his positive attitude toward the journey etc.	2.0	3.0		3.0																					
6712	3	In this essay by Joe Kurmaskie, a young man is baited into accepting outdated information by a group of old men. He pays for it later when on his bicycle, he is almost killed by heatstroke or dehydration. The setting is an excellent way to portray his feelings of hopelessness, despair, and fatigue. While he is just starting out, the road is flat and easy. It is cool and breezy. When he begins to run out of water, the terrain becomes bumpier and harder. He sees empty plains, cracked, dry ground, and the hot sun. He begins to despair even more. After a while when he thinks he can go no more he sees a store that once held gallons of grape juice. He laughs at the irony. The setting does do a wonderful job of describing his sense of helplessness.	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
6716	3	"The setting in the story ""Rough road ahead” plays a great role on the characters journey. Some features that are mentioned in the story are heat, rough road, long crippling hills and a abandoned Grape Juice Factory. The heat in the story drives the cyclist into a dying thirst. @CAPS1 does her best to conserve her water through out the trip but the dry dessert heat doesn’t allow it. Then comes the rough road ahead. The cyclist trys to keep a steady and secure pass as @CAPS1 peddels along the bumps and breaks in the road. The long crippling hills are next in line the cyclist has to use all her energy to work up the hill. @CAPS1 wipes the sweat from her eyes to make sure its not a mirage and then @CAPS1 see’s it the abandoned factory. This is where the cyclist loses all hope for if @CAPS1 doesn’t receive water soon @CAPS1 is sure to be eaten by the birds. “Then, and easily as rounding a band, my troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind me. Gary and Wilber Fish Camp.” @CAPS1 rushed to the bathroom to drink the refreshing water to the sink pride and accomplishment overwhelm her."	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
6726	3	The cyclist depicted in the essay is greatly effected by his surroundings. First, he described a beating sun and pines and rushing rivers. All these items are very animated things. The river is even described as rushing instead of, maybe violent. The setting is active just like the cyclist. Next, a ramshackle shed is acknowledged, as well as rusty pumps and a bad souding corral. When these old, forsaken things one mentioned, it can be noticed that the cyclist starts being a little in despair. And to tap that off, he drinks water that tastes like “battery acid.” Battery eats at skin just like the setting is eating at the cyclist.	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
6727	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead” the setting is able to affect the cyclists emotions and moods in both positive and negative ways. As the author travels through the desert he is already upset because it is so hot and water is scarce showing how the terrain is a negative influence. Another example would be when the author first sees the old water pump and he is relieved showing positive influence but the pump oozes a shine like substance he referrs to as tasting like “battery acid” changing his mood for the worst. Finally, the pebbles he puts in his math show is desperation and willingness to try anything to survive show a new posotive outlook on the desert until a pump “lodges are in his thro at” making yet another negative influence. All of these feature lead him on his way to “Gary and will fish camp” and grounded an extra boost on his journey through the desert.	3.0	3.0		3.0

However, as he continues down the winding road, his environment makes him doubt theirjudgement.

The cyclist runs across ""ramshackle shed[s]"" and shut down factories, and as his water supply sinks lower, the road seems to tantalize him. He passes a water pump (just what he needs), yet the water is something close to toxic. A road sign reminds him not go too fast, though he @MONTH1 die if he doesn't pick up the pace. He is forced to look at a picture ofa happy boy guzzling grape juice as he dehydrates.

Not only having a chance to be killed of dehydration or being ran over. Riding bike is really hard work when having to ride in hundred degree weather. Drinking drink after drink never having any water. No water and it being so hot could cause a heat stroke.

6740	3	In this story it is clear how difficult the cyclists journey is. He has to conquer wrong directions, lack of water, rattle snakes and fear of dieng. However he shows great determination and control. An example of his determination is “The old guys had sworn the next town was only eighteen miles down the road. I could make that. “This shows his determination that he feels he can go on such a long journey. An example of his self-control is shown in paragraphs @NUM1 and @NUM2. When finding this building to be abandoned, and all things, juice, anyone use would have become frustrated and wanted to give up. But not this cyclist he controlled his anger and again showed determination. And it paid off in the end he found his water and survived.

6741	3	Early in the morning, the cyclist is eager and ready to face the adventurous path that had been mapped out by the older travelers. He hardly noticed the “sun was beginning to beat down.” He was calm and was looking forward to the “cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite.” Never once did he imagine what he had gotten himself into. As he began to approach the desert, he noticed he was running low on water. The strenuous activity of biking combine d with the scorching heat of the desert began to take effect. The cyclist was so desperate for water that he had to put pebbles into his mouth. He had once read, “that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to circulate.” The cyclist was hoping for a way out of the misery he had come across. Dehydration took it’s toll, and he felt hallucinations. He was beginning to lose hope. The heat and the hills and the lack of water had the greatest affect on the cyclist. Had he not been riding through a hilly desert one afternoon in June, he would have been fine.	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
6748	3	Certin features of the setting affected the cyclist. In the essay by Joe Kurmaskie, he desribes he’s experiences when he cycled through the desert. ''...arrived at the first town''...it fit the traditional difinition of a ghost town. ''at first the cyclist was amused at this town and maybe a little scketle at it because the old “codgers”  told it to be thriving. Halfway through his journey the stated ''sometimes life can be so cruel.” Water was running low and he still had a ways to go untill he made it to the park and he felt as If it would never end. All that he sees aroun him as hills of nothingness under the sorching son with his limited amount of water. No buildings are around the cyclist. The ghost town and the lack of shade or soluation are very features of the setting that make that cyclist feel like a fool for taking advice from older men.        	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
6751	3	The features of the setting in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie affects the cyclist in many ways. For example it states “This place might have been a thriving little spot before the last world war it fit the tradition definition of a ghost town.” This statement is talking about town he arrived at when he was trying to get to Yosemite. This would affect the cyclist because he was riding in confidence in the beginning but then the first town he arrives in looks like a ghost town, which would bring his confidence a little bit lower than before. Just like when people travel when they know where they are going they feel good, but once they come to a place they know then they wont feel so confident. Another example is when he has to ride on rolling hills, and then comes across a “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” sign. This would affect the cyclist because then he would be frustrated and stressed out because he rode all that way and not he cant go any further, and that is not the place he wanted to be at. Therefore the features of the setting in “Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie affects the cyclist.	2.0	3.0		3.0																					
6755	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly. There were hills and rocks, snakes and no buildings or people. The hills and rocks would make it much harder to to stay strong and be able to keep riding. The abandoned building and there being no people, could affect him emotionally. It would make him loose hope and the determination to keep going to find destination. He did not think he would get that after seeing a deserted town. After all, he did say, “It didn’t really matter. I was going to die … “(Kurmaskie).	3.0	2.0		3.0

In the beginning of the essay, the author is confident and happy, and the setting is, “a reservoir camp ground outside at Lodi, California” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). This sounds like a good place to be refreshed and to feel confident. Later into the bike ride, the author is affected negatively by the barren area he comes to when he says, “This sight was troubling"" (Kurmaskie @NUM1). Finally when he reaches a modern store, he is relieved due to the modern facility when he states, “Then, as easily as rounding a bend, my troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind me” (Kurmaskie @NUM3).

6760	3	“At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path..” being out in the desert with limited or no water can make one feel like life is very cruel. The sun was beating down and no water or shade is seen when he reaches a point. The sign that said “Rough @CAPS1 ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” had to be intimidating. Considering he was on a bike he could only move so fast. Those old men probably were never off their front porch since carter was in office. yes like the writer said “the world is a fluid place.  Things  change.” The old men probably had close to no due what they were talking about considering things have changed since @NUM1 (when carter was in office). The snake that he came upon, must have been rather intimidating. Knowing there is a creature like that, there is bound to be more.

After getting outdated directions from some elderly locals, the protagonist sets off on his journey to Yosemite National Park. Soon thereafter, the cyclist notices something is amiss. The first “town” the locals said he’d find is deserted. And now, twenty miles into his journey, the cyclist needs to refill some of his water supply. The water pump there has “the flavor of battery acid.” With the next town @NUM1 miles away, the cyclist struggles to conserve his water to make it there. Even then, things get worse. As he is, “traveling through the high deserts of California in June”, “flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.” @CAPS1 tell him not to exceed the speed limit of @NUM2 as he does a “water-depleting @NUM3.” eventually, even on his few sips of water, the cyclist finds a spot to fill up on water, knowing now to strike out on better days and better directions.	2.0	3.0		3.0																					
6764	3	Each new feature of the setting in the essay entilled, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” by Joe Kurmaskie, affects the cyclist in some way. For example, in the text , when the narrator stated that he had to avoid a “ ridiculously large snake “crossing the road, he became more aware of his surroundings and almost seemed to forget how thirsty he was until he finally abided the large reptile. Also in the text, when, “over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view,” hope was replenished into the cyclist. This hope allowed the narrator to because more tenacious about his journey in order to arrive at the old building. Eighther for better or worse, a few feature of the setting arrives and affects the cyclist every step of his journey.  	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
6765	3	Many features of the setting of the cyclist’s excruciating trip affect him mentally and physically. When he first sets out, the pine trees and rivers kept him cheerfully riding through the landscape. When he sees the corral and the rusty pumps, he becomes discouraged and begins to notice his tiredness and thirst. When the cyclist encounters a rough terrain with tumble weeds and snakes, he is both mentally and physically exhausted. He begins to doubt his consciousness and worries that he @MONTH1 not complete the journey. The abandoned grape juice factory is also a let  down for the cyclist’s mental state. When all hope is seemingly lost, he finally comes across water, and his unique (but very important) lesson is learned.	2.0	3.0		3.0																					
6779	3	The setting in  “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” adds drama into the story by how it affects the cyclist. He was tacking through the “high desert of California in June”. June is a hot part of the year and since he was in the hottest desert part the hot was multiplied. The terrain changing into “short rolling hills” didn’t help the cyclist. The hills would make any riding more difficult. Anyone who ride a bicycle knows it takes more effort to go up a hill than on a flat pavement. With the person lack of water anyone would be struggling to keep riding on. Most people didn’t have that hints to keep moving. He didn’t set a very goal he just went to the “next Horizon”. Shouldn’t he just wanted to keep going. Another problem with the physical environment was the road conditions. When the “Rough Road Affect” sign appeared the travel then become more difficult. A bike tire take more effort to go over uneven pavement is why the cyclist had so much trouble.	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
6780	3	"In the story “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie the setting affected the cyclist in a hard way. With only a few sips of water left he said'' … abandoned years earlieR, by the looks of it it had been a @CAPS1 Grape Juice factory and bottling plant. A sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of Juice into his mouth could still be seen. I hung my head.'' When only having a few drops of water and seeing that would have increased my thirst more. Another way the setting affected the cyclist in a hard way was "" The speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph. sometime ife can feel so cruel.'' This remind him that hes not in a car, and that hes not even going half the speed limit. The setting affects the cyclist by reminding him how long his journey is, and now at this point he is suffering."	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
6789	3	At first when he gets the directions from the old men, he thinks he will be fine. When he gets to the first town he’s tired and almost out of water, but still thinks he will be in Yosemite soon. When he gets to the water pump in the middle of the desert, he’s tired and thirsty and he realizes that the directions the old men gave him were out of date. He’s really not happy about listening to them and not following his map. When he gets to the fishing place he is greatful for the water in the sink and for the rest and when the old man offers to give directions to Yosemite he thinks he will just use his map. Throughout the story the cyclists needs change from feeling confident to feeling depressed to feeling relived.	2.0	3.0		3.0																					
6794	3	The setting effected the cyclist because it was bumpy and had a lot of hills which means he has to work harder. Also because of the heat he was getting dehydrated in the story after the cyclist had Been rideing a long time it says “I eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state “(kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist had very little water for his long trip	2.0	3.0		3.0																					
6798	3	The features of the surrounding landscape affect the cyclist both physically and mentally. First, the sun constantly beating down on the cyclist causes his or her body to sweat more, which makes one’s body use more energy. The sun rays also add to the heat the cyclist feels. Also, the rough road forces the cyclist to pedal very hard, which drains him or her of even more energy. For example, when the cyclist in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” reached the rough roads, he had to pedal harder, which made him sweat more, and caused his amount of energy to decrease. Finally, the lack of civilization can make a cyclist feel hopeless, which is how the cyclist in the essay felt when he had no water or could see no nearby town. This can affect the cyclist’s will to keep pedaling, and if they have no determination, the cyclist will not go anywhere. The features of the setting can physically exhaust and mentally strain the cyclist, which makes it harder for him or her to keep going	3.0	2.0		3.0

In the story it says “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" This is showing that the terrain is opposing him. Also in the story it says “The speed limit was 55. I was doing a water depleted 12 mph. Sometimes life can be so cool.” This is not only showing how much the elements are owning him it also shows how is risle he is, and how satiricle life can be. The ultimate @CAPS1 in this story is when he stumbels across the welches grape juice factory and there was a piture of a boy ""pouring a refreshing glass of juice in his mouth.” No matter where the cycalist goes he is alway trying to overcome the elements."	2.0	3.0		3.0																					
6804	3	Author Joe Kurmaskie learns the dangers of a lifeless wilderness during his experience described in “do not exceed posted speed limit.” As a cyclist riding in one of the most undeveloped areas in California, the lack of water found in this setting proves crippling to his survival. The trails he was directed to had no towns or sources of fresh, drinkable water for days. The combination of constant exercise riding through the terrain, lack of water and recources, California summer weather and lack of civilization trained the author’s energy and caused him to suffer from dehydration. Too much exposer to these conditions could have killed him. The modern time period and year also caused the directions the author were given to be in accurate, and, thus, causing the cyclist to find him self in such a dangerous area of the country. The setting of “do not exceed posted speed limit” places the cyclist in a life threatening situation.	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
6805	3	The features of a setting could be a number of different things. It could be snowing and cold, raining and of course wet, hot and dry, breezy and humid. The features could be a busy tough or a solitere country road, there could be rough terrain or straight aways. The setting of a place puts pressure of the reality of what will happen on a cyclist. In the essay a young cyclist takes advice from some elderly man and ends up riding through hot sun and ghost towns not knowing if he would survive. The heat had him feeling as though death were coming on him and the thirst had him becoming more determined to get to the next town so he could survive. If the features of the setting had been different, say he was riding on a flat road in a busy town with a breeze and places to stop for water everywhere he would not have feared for his life. The features of the setting affect how the cyclist feels and thinks. He can feel angry, happy, sad or scared and he can start to think about his own death. These have been what I believe some of the effects settings have on cyclist.	2.0	3.0		3.0																					
6809	3	In the story, the setting greatly effects the attitude of the cyclist. When he starts out, it is an early summer evening, he is serene while he is talking to the old men. He starts cycling the next morning and he is thinking of Yosemite, he is relaxed and confident however, his attitude about the day changes greatly when he comes across the rumshackle old shed, rusty pumps, and a corral at the park in the road. He becomes a little worried but he is not discouraged. When the terrain changes, he is a little discouraged. Then, when he comes across the abandoned factory, he is most definately a lot discouraged. A little later he comes across @PERSON1’s Fish camp, he is very relieved and thankful to the owners. The cyclist’s attitude changed depending upon whether the setting was very beneficial to him or not.	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
6810	3	The features of the setting have a great affect on the desperate travels of the weary cyclist. The sometimes disappoint, sometimes uplifting, scenery he passes affect him physically and emotionally when he passes a portrin the road with nothing but a “ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral…” he becomes disturbed.  The cyclist is running low on water when he becomes even more distraught at a road with a speed limit posted as 55 mph, when he was, “doing a water-deleting @NUM1.” The setting of the hot, June sun affects the cyclist and puts him in a state of dehydration. In an, “ironic twist” the cyclist is affected emotionally when he passes a @ORGANIZATION1 factory that has been abandoned. The factory features a picture of a boy pouring a glass of juice into his mouth which upsets the thirsty cyclist.	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
6811	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist more than anything in the reading of “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted speeding Limit.” In the beginining when the cyclists had just begun his cycling cause he uses a positive tone to describe the setting. For example, in paragraph four he says “the cool pines and running rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them. “ When he says this the reader imagines someone in an ??? more excited as ??? ??? ??? ??? his destination on a dry day.  As the cyclists attitude becomes lower the reader makes the connection what ?? ?? then because of the setting. In paragraph thirteen when the cyclist says, “I wiped the swear from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage and that not to get too excited” the reader can make the connection that it is getting pretty serious for the cyclist to continue as is. Overall as the setting changes to “burning sun” and extremely hot, with a shortage of water the cyclist becomes more sarcastic and less upheat. For example when taking about the rocks in his mouth he states “with only luck I’d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat.” This shows a bad mood affected by the features of the setting.	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
6816	3	Many of the settings features affect the cyclist. One of the features of the dessert like, which is the setting, is the dry air and hot temperatures. This heat made it had for the cyclist to keep going, with despair the author says, ”I was going to die and the birds world pick me clean.” @CAPS1 feature of the setting was the desolet towns that didn’t contain any water. This lack of the water made it horrible for him to continue on. The thirst was so bad that he had to put pebbles in his mouth to sucking on stones helps take your and off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to circulates. @CAPS1 features of the setting that affected the cyclist was the abandoned Welch’s Grape factory. This  factory gave the cyclist false hope because it would have been so great to have some grape juice during his thirst stricken state. The narrator called the factory.”Ironic  twist.”	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
6818	3	Many features of the setting affect the cyclist. For instance, in the story, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the lack of water in the dry desert gave a long lasting affect on the cyclist. “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn’t been off their porch in decades, caused me to laugh.” This shows the reader how all the heat and shortage of water has made the cyclist feel very hot dehydraded and that she could pass out any second. She is also thinking beyond that by just laughing at herself and trying to conserve every bit of energy she possibly can. As a result, the affect from the setting on the cyclist is that lack of water has given her humor and courage to keep going, to get to her final destination point.	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
6822	3	"At first the cyclist feels fine, he gets a little bit discouraged, but basically he’s fine. “The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them” (@CAPS1). He feels relaxed, because he is at home with the water and the pine trees. They give him a sense of comfort. He thinks that after the first ""tree"" not being that much of anything, the others will be better. He knows that he has it in him to make it, but he doesn’t know yet that he will have to travel a long way to get water. When he sees the sign, “It read: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT.” he knows that things are going to get rough, because “the speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph”. At that point he starts to get worried, because he is out there more alone, and he realizes that he doesn’t have water. As he runs out of water, the landscape, and his surroundings, start to get drier and drier. He states, “tumble weeds crossed my path.” The landscape seems to get more threatening too, “a ridiculously large shake.” The landscape changes with the state of water."	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
6825	3	Joe Kurmaskie’s “Rough Road ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” tells how a cyclist takes directions from older men who don’t tell him correctly the way to get to Yosemite, so the cyclist ends up lost with hardly any water. Features of the setting such as the terrain and the sun affect the cyclist in the story. The sun was very hot on a summers day and without water makes it even difficult to keep moving because he was so hot and thirsty. @PERSON2, “The sun was beginning to beat down… I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The terrain was also bumpy and rough to travel on. The sun and the terrain can affect the cyclist very much when out on a hot day in the summer.	3.0	1.0		3.0																					
6831	3	After reading “Do not Exceed Posted Limit” I have seen how the scene of an area can effect your mood and attitude around things. In this story, the main character is a cyclist who takes the advice of a few old men sitting in a poseh who tell him a bad shortcut. As he is riding, he comes across some hills. Those hills really affected him physically he gets tired from peddling up and down continually. “that mood” was replaced by short, moving hills.” The cyclist could not er nuertecy tried everything, not showing how long he have to continue going up and down. There at one point he says, “@CAPS1 can feel so cruel.” There, he is upset because a road sign come up through acid tough roads, and told him not to exceed 55 miles per hour when he was fully going 12 miles per hour. This can be viewed as metaphorical also. When you take a short cut in life, there are always consciences as you decide to drop out of high school is go on how with your journal, where is always the posibility of is not working, and where you cry with no diploma ?? and he gets a job	3.0	3.0		3.0

6849	3	In the essay, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting greatly affected the cyclist. In this story, the cyclist is heading for Yosemite National Park, thinking it wise, he accepts directions from a group of eccentric old men. He begins his journey confidently on flat terrain and with a large supply of water. The first of three promised towns had been resigned to that of a ghost town. The second offered only water that slightly resembled battery acid. The cyclist soon becomes exhausted from lack of water and having to cross the now hilly terrain. He barely makes it to the third town to realize that the juice factory was out of business. The cyclist becomes sure that he is going to die of lack of water when he stumbles across a bait store. If it hadn’t been so hot, if the “towns” along the way had offered better resources and if the terrain hadn’t been so hilly, the cyclist would have had a very enjoyable ride. All of the affore mentioned factors of the setting greatly affected the cyclist.	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
6852	3	The cyclist in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed @CAPS1” was riding through the California dessert in June. This dry, bare setting made it impossible to find any source of water. The only time that this cyclist found water was when it @NUM1 and tasting of battery acid. There was nowhere for him to find water for miles. This lack of water and scorching heat made him travel slow and wearily. He even says that he could only go 12 mph in a 55 mph zone. By taking the advise of the old men and taking a “short cut”, the cyclist past through ghost towns with no water. This “short cut” prolonged his trip, most likely by hours If he had gone through populated area despite the fact that it is a longer path, there would have been more water to drink, which would allow him to go faster. The dry, hot setting of the old men’s “short cut” made this cyclist’s trip last much longer than nessiarry.	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
6853	3	When the man began cycling he thought that this was going to be an easy for ride. For example in paragraph @NUM1 he says “Things began well enough. I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.” As he got further he realized that he was in the middle of nowhere. The scenery was getting more and more empty. There was eventually nothing. The scenery was putting down his hope of ever getting out of the desert. For example: In paragraph @NUM2 it states, “a large highway sign jumped out of me. It read: Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” He realized this was going to be hard. He had to travel in bumpy roads and pass snakes without getting bit. The scenery created a sense of hopeless because it was abandoned. When he saw the bait shop, his spirits lifted and he was now hopeful and relieved.	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
6858	3	During the authors ride to Yosemite, he doesn’t have the proper tools to go along the long stretch of desert he was to face, and by tools I mean water. The California desert is extremely hot and can be potentially dangerous depending on your situation the author was describing how the lack of water was affecting him. He described this with sentences like “Rattled around the dry honey combs of my deteriorating brain.” The author clearly cannot face the rugged heat with his immense lack of water. The author was getting neat stroke being passed by @LOCATION2  desert snakes and tumbleweeds. The author was clearly in a struggle against the @LOCATION2 desert heat.	2.0	3.0		3.0																					
6863	3	How the features of the setting affects the cyclist is the condition of the roads, rolling hill, and the?? heat. The conditions of the road in the settings affect the cyclist because the roads are rough. An example firm the texted is “ I noticed that terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short ralling hills. These condition make is hard for the cycled it gives him a challenge.  The rolling hills challange him a regret to stay on the road it is easly tricky and challenges so was The heat & sun was also played an affection on the cyclist. An Examples from the @CAPS1 is.” I chuckled, checked my water supply and moved on. The sun was beginning to heat doing but I barely not ???. the sun was not starting to get him  ?? sharply ??

The setting is the high deserts of California"" where it is June and very hot. The path of the cyclist suggested by some old men makes the heat even worse because there are no people or water in sight. In the essay, the cyclist starts out the day confident and excited for his ride to Yosemite National Park. His mood changes throughout the day as after @NUM1 miles he arrives in a ""ghost town"" the old men led him to believe would be a settled town where he could get more supplies and cool off. Soon as the temperature rises to what feels like ""two hundred degrees"" the cyclist begins to run low on water and feels ""sometimes life can feel so cruel."" The heat and lack of people and water lead the cyclist to desperation and make him feel like as he says ""i was going todie."" The setting of the cyclists journey provides the mood of hopelessness and amplifies the feeling of determination felt by the cyclist to keep going at all costs because he was going to die if he stopped. The author, @PERSON1 uses the setting of the essay to help bring across his mesage that by blindly trustting people instead of trusting yourself things could end up being hard for you to overcome..

For examples the “ghost town” that he ran into at first really put a load on him because he had no one to ask for futher directions or somewhere to freshen up. Futher on down the road the hill he came up on was a physical obsticle that he had to go over. With the sun beating on his back and the emptiness of the road he might have begin to want to turn back. He kept on persaveering which was how he made it down. The lack of water also mad it difficult for him.

He starts out good, then comes to a “Rough Road” and he even says “sometimes life can feel so cruel”.

This implies that it is very hot outside. I can tell the people in towns didn't help him because the text says, ""Never accept travel advice from collection of old-timers who havent left the confines of their porches since carter was in office.

6899	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in a larger way, almost resulting in a very sevior situation. The cyclist was in a desert. Like terria, which was not dinsely populated on his trail, there was a lack of fresh water supplys, and the tempatures is more extreme. The cyclist could easily have faintid from heatstroke, due to the lack of water and excessive heat and work that his was doing peatling. Had the area been more populated, he would have had more chances to stock up on water greatly indecriasing his risk of heat stroke. There was also the snakes which presentid danger for him, has he been bitting then he would be at least @NUM1 miles from the closet help which could proven fetal. Had the setting been, say a city park, on a populated country side, them thi setting would had provided exponeutaly loss prodioms and dangers for the cyclist.	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
6904	3	“Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” is an inspiring and almost humorous essay it take the reader inside a journey in a cyxlist daily routine. In this story the author fights dehydration as he tries to make to a national park with shortcut directions from “old timers” the setting of this storygreatly affects the cyclist and the pitty the reader feels for him. Half way through the essay, the biker had already traveled roughly @NUM1 miles; that’s extremely crazy. The fact that he is travelling through California deserts in June is even harder to believe. The first time he mentions the setting, he states he is in a ghost town, two sentences after he states that the sun was beating down. At that point he wasn’t really bothered. Another description of his setting that probably affected his ability to peddle was when he states “flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.” He was already dehydrated and had already traveled so far, the rocky roads probably didn’t help his journey much. The setting basically made the story. If he wouldn’t have been peddling in the desert, it would have just been another trip in his life. The setting makes the reader see what cyclist really go through. 	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
6915	3	In Joe Kurmaskie’s “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed @CAPS1” the imagery is what sets the cyclist back. The scorching dessert and plant life gives him a sense of seclusion and scares him. Because the cyclist is in the  dessert he keeps on worrying about his water and heatstroke where as if he where in a rain forest he wouldn’t worry about water or heat. I think he siked himself out just by taking in his sorroundings. If the cyclist would have pictured water all around him and arctic like temperatures I think he wouldn’t have been so worried. What’s interesting about this story is that if he would have gotten himself prepared mentally for the conditions he wouldn’t have struggled so much at the end. “At some point tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake- it really did look like a diamond back blocking the majority the pavement in front of me.”(Kurmaskie @NUM1). If the cyclist word of concentrated more on the task at hand and less on what was going on around him I think he would of succeeded without as much stress.  	2.0	3.0		3.0

But the next thing he sees is a rundown old shed and a “rusted water pump,” and this troubles him because he is running out of water. Then he sees a huge snake which does not help his mood, because the snake is blocking his path then he passes an abandoned Welch’s Grape Juice factory and despairs that he will never find water.

6921	3	Poor directions heat, and lack of water affect the cyclist in the story. At the beginning of the story, the cyclist is confident in the directions which would, “slice away hours from my ride to Yosemite National Park.”  As the story progresses, the cyclist is no longer so confident. The “heat of the California, June day causes him to be fluent in drinking water.” I had been hitting my water bottle pretty regularly, and I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June.” This lack of water is a big problem for the cyclist, so big that he was near heat stroke. “I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” He braved the elements and forced himself on, with hopes that any source of water would reveal itself to him. His perseverance paid off. “Then , as easily as rounding a bend, my troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind me. The cyclist had found a barst shop and recteved water.	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
6923	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. First, because there was no one in sight he couldn’t ask for any help or direction. Also, because of all the road conditions it was hard to ride a bike through all the rocky roads and he was very tired and dehydrated so that didn’t help him it just tired him more. Another reason is because of the poisonous snakes if he disturbed them they could harm him. Also, if he would had fallen off his bike a snake could have biten him and then he wouldn’t be able to make it anywhere because of the bite. Those are the features of the setting that affected the cyclist.	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
6926	3	”Do not Exceed the posted speed limit” tells a story of learning and determination, as one cyclist bikes through the deserts of California,  encountering obstacles such as snakes and a lack of water along the way.  The descriptive features of the setting greatly affect the protagonist along his journey. The essay takes place in the early summer. As the cyclist prepares to retire for the day, he takes particular note of “the serenity of an early summer evening,” and ends the day feeling calm. The next morning he is excited and rejuvenated, ready to bike again. The heat rises as the day goes on, and by mid-day the cyclist begins to worry about his water supply. He boldly continues forth reaching new terrain, rolling hills. Here he begins to lose hope, and is disappointed when he seem the “town” he hoped to find is an abandoned juice factory. The cyclist thinks he is going to die due to the heat and lack of hydration, but gathers his strength to turn the final bend, and reaches a bait shop where he can stop and get water, he is finally relieved. In conclusion, as the cyclist continues his journey through the California desert, the change in both weather one terrain coincide and affect the cyclist’s change in physical and mental strength to continue traveling.	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
6931	3	The journey of a solo cyclist is a lonely one. The cyclist in “Do not exceed posted speed limit” had a particulaly hard journey, as made even worse by the setting. His main opponent in the battle of staying alive was the heat. In the California deserts as a day in June. It was no surprise that the sun would be heating down particularlly harder than it would at another place anytime. Also, as the terrain became hillier, his journey became even harder. There is nothing hard about biking in a flat straight line. But constantly peadling yourself up steep hills and around winding roads is no picnic. Just like the buildings around him, the cyclist’s water deteriorated as did his state of mind as his trip which started out very joyful became increasingly more mardid. “It didn’t really matter, I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean. This cyclist was fighting against strong forces of nature.	2.0	3.0		3.0																					
6933	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because they started to mess with her mind. She didn’t knew where she was and on hip of that got lost. Whether you see nothing around. You or alot around you, you’re going to feel scared. They have the same affect. In the authors case, she was cycling and didn’t/couldn’t and water. This is an over whelming feeling because you can die from dehydration. She then kept cycling and saw nothing. “no one insight; not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” That is alatining no water or people around, as if you are going to be just left to die. These settings would affect anyone who came across them. They dffinately affected the cyclist because she was by herself, and on her dvun. Plus, all she had was a map, her bike and an empty water bottle.	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
6940	3	The features of the setting in “Rough Road:Do Not Exceed the Posted Speed Limit”by Joe kurmaskie affects the cyclist in a very negative way.It begins slowly with the “ghost town”.The narrorator “chuckled, checked my water supply and moved on,” he wasn’t especially worried,but the fact he checked his water suggests that he’ll need to ration it for a while.The decline continues when he reaches the fock and the “ramshackle shed.”@CAPS1 the description of the place shows you he did not like it,and he confirms that with the words,“this sight was troubling.”He wouldn’t be replenishing his water here.Any more of this he’d be dead,either from dehydration or from pessimism.Eventually he reached the road sign which declared that going over 55 mph was a bad idea.This is ironics,he only going 12 mph to put it in his own words,“sometimes life can be so cruel.”He quite obviously hates the setting,and it’s all the fault of the setting.	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
6944	3	In the story “Rough Road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie the feature of the setting seem negative to the cyclist. The setting seems to start worrying the cyclist two miles after he said that he could make the next @NUM1 miles easily. For example the cyclist says “Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills, “the cyclist seems worried at that point that things aern’t going to be as easy as they seemed they were going to be. From that point on the setting seemed to get worse for the cyclist later on the cyclist ends up saying “It didn’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” That was when the cyclist began to notice his fear of dehydration. The cyclist ended up making it and he realized what a big effect nature can have on you.	2.0	3.0		3.0																					
6946	3	"The setting in “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not @CAPS1 Posted Speed Limit definitely affected the author. The cyclist states, ""Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills"" (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist probably found it more difficult to navigate  through the ""hills"" as opposed to the ""Flat roads,"" making him more quickly tired. The speaker states, “I could drop from heatstroke” (Kurmaskie @NUM2). The speaker is implying that it is so hot outside that he could faint from a ‘heatstroke’ which could slow him down. The speaker also states,""water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees""(Kurmaskie @NUM3). The author did not have any good water to drink, because it was so hot outside, which affected him in that he was dehydrated. Many aspects of the setting affected the cyclist.

6949	3	The setting of this short story has a big affect on the cyclist. Since the story takes place in the desert, the temperature is very hot. The cyclist only packed enough water for the intended trip. Since he made a few wrong turns, he ended up needing more water. There were no signs of civilization so he could not stop any where and buy water. He came to a “run-down” rusty fauret and tried to drink water from it, but it was hot and tasted like battery acid. If this short story had a different setting, then the story would not make much sense. For example, if the story would have taken place in @LOCATION1 he could have just stopped and bought water. The setting is one of the most important elements in a story.	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
6957	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in several ways. The first was the terrain, which started out flat, then turned to hills. The cyclist was growing tired from all the pedaling. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” This tired him out faster, since going uphill is harder than riding flat terrain. The heat definitely affected him, because it made him thirsty. He was “travelling through the high deserts of California in June.” This is a very hot time of year, and when a person get lost without conserving water, which he had not done, a person get extremely thirsty. Not to mention the “sandblasted picture of a young boy pourng a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth,” which would remind the body of its thirst. So the setting most definitely affected the cyclist	2.0	3.0		3.0																					
6958	3	In the story, the cyclist iS greatly affected by the features of the setting. For example, the setting has no thing for miles. Just ghost towns, makes it imposible to find any water. Also it’s a desert like setting, adding to his thirst. Another example is the hills, that made him even more thirsty. It was June in California so it must have been pretty hot and also the town that he are to had no water because they seemed desorted. Another example is the state he put under his tongue. It’s a trick that lets you survive alot more effectively. Therefore the settings affected his journey and made him wish he didn’t take the old mans advice.	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
6961	3	In “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting affects the cyclist. The cyclist takes advice from some old guys and ends up wishing he never did. He is on an empty road, flat and dry. He ends up drinking all of the water he has, and needing to stop for some more.” I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” He stopped to get more water, but once, all that came out was some tar like stuff, and then he couldn’t find another place for quite a white. The flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills and he came to a sigh that said “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit”, and passed tumble weeds and a large snake. All of these things impacted his journey with fear, caution, etc. When he finally reached a place to get a drink, he was finally satisfied. Because it was hot, and empty, he was more thirsty so therefore the setting affected the cyclist.	2.0	3.0		3.0																					
6965	3	The features of the setting intensely effect the cyclist over period of time. Destined to reach yosemite national park from Lodi, California, a determined cyclist rode strongly through the gentle evening strongly. When the setting changed, so did the effect it had on the cyclist. When the man reached the first town, which was deserted, energy began depleting because the sun began to come into the picture. next, he came to a shed desperate for water only to find rusty pumps with tainted, unsafe water. When the flat terrain turned to rolling hills, the man was entirely exhausted”. With what I believed to be my last burst of enery, I manevuered down the hill”. That quote directly describes what the man was feeling and how the hills effected him. When the man stumbled across a fish camp with water, he became reloaded and replerilshed with confidence he had before when he “rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile”	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
6967	3	"In the essay “Do Not @CAPS1 Posted Speed Limit” the setting effects the cyclist in many ways. When the cyclist arrived at the first town, he described it as a ghost town. This effected the cyclist because he started to have doubts about the directions he received, but he was looking foward to the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite so he persevered. The setting of the next land mark was similar to the last. There was a shed, a few rusty pipes and a corral that ""Couldn’t hold in the lamest mule.” This made the cyclist more werry of the path ahead because he was running out of water. The next place was also similar. There was an abandoned @ORGANIZATION1. The cyclist was running out of water and now thought he was going to die because everything was deserted. Then, finally, the setting changed. There was a store that was actually opened. The cyclist then felt happy and relieved. That is how the different settings effected the cyclist."	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
6968	3	The author’s setting described a difficult terrain and harsh weather for bike riding. The author said that it was early summer which means it could be hot and uncomfortable weather for the cyclist. The author also that when the cyclist reached the first town, the sun began to heat down. That means the temperature is going to rise since the sun is getting stronger. Riding a bike in hot weather is very difficult because it takes a lot of effort and makes your body dehydrate faster because the heat makes you sweat which lowers your water retention. Another feature of the setting that the author described was the cyclist’s location. He was traveling through the high deserts of California. This gives you a sense of how much hotter it is since he’s traveling through deserts during early summer while the sun is high. After the first couple town, he starts to ride on short, rolling hills. Hills take a bigger toll on a person’s body because it takes more effort to pedal up a hill.	3.0	2.0		3.0

He had to spend more energy to go up the hills which caused him to loss a certain amount of  energy. Then, his lack of water caused him a dehydrated state. He could loss an another large amount of energy by this and out of this stage, he mostly needs someone to support him or be on his side, but he was riding alone, there was no one on sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind.

The next building he saw was an abondoned Welch’s Juice bottle factory, on the building was a singn with a boy drinking a cold glass of juice. This intimidates the reacher the begins to question the wisdom of the old men. Continuing on he reaches another building. To his relief its a bolt shop that was still in business. He goes to the sink immediately to drink the water at this point he is relieved to have water $ be near civilization instead of in dessert without a sight of liFe or building.

6989	3	"In the essay, “Rough Road ahead"" the character sees many settings through his ride, all of which affect his mood and physical condition. For example, when the author describes one place he came to as, “one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mute greeted me. Thes sight was troubling”, this was the turning point where the cyclist began to worry. He was running out of water, “The sun was beginning to beat down”, and he was probably tired of pedaling. But, to make matters worse, he came to rolling hills. This affected him because he had to work harder and had less water to pick him up. When he finally got to a “modernized” town his spirits were lifted, and he was able to get water to cool him down. This gave him more strength and will-power to continue his trip Yosemite park."	3.0	2.0		3.0

Next the story says, “I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June”, California’s temperature is really high and June is one of the hottest months of the year. The temperature was very high and the cyclist did not have much water left. This was affecting the cyclist because he was tired, hot, and getting dehydrated. Finally, at the end of the story the terrains were changing and there had been more hills and a road that was not as smooth as pavement because it was a dirt road and the hills were making the cyclist have to cycle harder to go past making him very tired. Also the temperature was still very high and he did not have barely any water left.

7026	3	The setting in the essay “Rough Road Ahead” makes the bikers travel a very difficult challenge that he has to overcome. When the “flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,” the biker must use more energy to peddl up the hills. This made it hard on him to overcome his exauhtion of physical endurance. Also, he states that he was “traveling through the high desert of California in June” this weather is very hot and dry, therefor causing him to quickly run low on water. And, because he was in the desert, there was no sign of towns or people or salvation of any type. These conditions made it hard on the biker because he knew if he dropped from dehydration, no one would be around to save him. In conclution, these hard conditions challenged the bike a great deal.	2.0	3.0		3.0																					
7027	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The cyclist was on a very long bike ride to Yosemite National Park. However, on the way there, he had to cross through a desert like terrain. The blistering sun had been beating on his back for many miles. All the heat built up a desire for him to get water. He had been very tired. The terrain had made him drenched in sweat. If it wasn’t so hot, then he wouldn’t of had that much of a hard time. The desert contains a very high temperature, which makes it harder to endure physical activities. Even if you are to have a high endurance. The heat will make you very tired, and you will lose a lot of energy. Also, it didn’t help anything, that the elderly men, had gave him terrible directions. That is why I think the setting affected the cyclist.	2.0	3.0		3.0

The features of the setting are that “there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” The fact that there was nothing around him, made the author lose hope and trust. After the author saw the old juice factory, he felt like something was happening in his favor. Then he saw that it was abandoned and he lost all hope. He shows his loss of hope again when he talks about how he’s going to die. He shows that he’s lost trust in the old men when he talks about never accepting advice from “old-timers who haven’t left their porches since Carter was in office.” In conclusion, the features of the directions he was given and lose any hope of surviving.	3.0	2.0		3.0

As he moves on, and his water supply deplets, his mood sinks lower and he becomes more frustrated. In the ironic twist of fate that he finds a Welch’s Grape Juice, Factory, he is about to quit. He is dejected and almost ready to admit defeat. But he forces himself to go on, and when he finally reaches a place with water, his relief is mixed with wariness of the old man sitting on the porch.

7034	3	The features of the setting only drain the cyclist's willpower. The things he sees discourage him, for example one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps and a corral that couldn’t hold the larnest, mule greeted me. This sight was troubling .” The desolation begins to wear away his hope of finding a building or town sometimes the things are psychologically damaging,” In an ironic twist that should please all sadists reading this, the building abandoned years earlier, by the looks of it – had been a Welch’s Grape Juice factory and bottling plant. A sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen.” For someone who is quickly running out of water, this this irony could make one lose their resolve to continue. The snake and rolling hills slow him down, and make him use more energy. The heat dehydrates the cyclist even faster. The environment is a hostile one for a cyclist.    	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
7036	3	During the cyclist trail there are many factors that play out to be disadvantages to him/her. There are rough roads, bad water pump, abandoned battling plant, and the long lasting truth that it wasn’t even his path. All of these factors create something new in the cyclist. As the cyclist recover the first town and realizes it is decreased he is initially amused. He then pedals on, but realizes his water is running low. Then , what is originally a sign of hope because another let down. A water pump found just in time, but the water is no longer any determination they reach “rough roads” creating, once again, a more painful journey. Finally, the cyclist sees a building in the distance, but again, deserted. The only goodness as the poor cyclist is when they came along a bait “tar, some sign of civilization that keeps him alive. Hope after hope arises to the end in turmoil upon turmoil. These encounters would cause oneself to become persimistic on even a task, but he sought through. These encounters create an interesting meal. Every time you catch word on hope you become entitled to what could happen next and then feel sorry for the cyclist after having hope on multiple occasions. The steady and salidrising the plot keeps the reader entitled wanting more.	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
7040	3	The features of the setting in the essay, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted speed limit” affect the cyclist. As the cyclist rides to his destination, he encounters obstacles and views his surroundings. The author gives the starting setting in the second paragraph as “a reservoir campground outside of lodi, California an early. Summer evening.” The reader is informed that the temperatures are not in summers in California. This gives the cyclist his main conflict, the lack of water. With temperatures being high, it is easier to become quickly dehydrated. The author stated, “The sun was beginning to beat down and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. Also, to cyclist encounters a ridiculously large” snake in the middle of the rode. The reader is aware that there are many conflicts which one can encounter while cycling. There are finally many features of the setting that let the cyclist know where he currently is, and the place where he wants to be most, the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite.” @CAPS1 the essay, the cyclist is determined to reach Yosemite, and although he faces troubles, he doesn’t give up and is relieved when he finally receives water.	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
7050	3	Throughout his journey, the protagonist in the story encounters obstacles in the setting. First off, he is cycling in the hot, dry, desert. There is no civilization or natural water source, so he faces dehydration. Additionally, the terrain he was riding on proved difficult. He encountered rolling hills that took a lot of energy to ride up. There were even signs for “rough road ahead,” @CAPS1 obstacle was a mental obstacle. He came across an abandoned juice factory when he needed an occupied building. These were ironic and mentally frustating. The cyclist must have lost hope in @CAPS2 civilization after he found @NUM1 abandoned examples of civilization. This discouragement must have made his journey more mentally challenging.	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
7053	3	The hot, dry, desert setting affects the cyclist in many different ways, “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June” (@NUM1). The cyclist is very hot. He was thirsty but, “A tarlike substance ooted out, followed by brakish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of zoo (@NUM2). The water was barely even water, so he didn’t have much to drink until the next town. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling  hills” (@NUM3). Flat road is much easier to bike on then hills. He was thirstier and more tired after biking on hills “A sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice in his mouth could still be seen” (@NUM4) on an old welchs grape fruit factory. This makes the cyclist envicus of the young boy. It also discourages him. In conclusion, the water being bad, the terrain change. the picture of the young boy, and the fact that the cyclist drinks a lot makes him tired, hot, envious, and generally exausted.	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
7054	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because when he has water and plenty of it, the setting seems to be smooth, easy riding. This means that he doesn’t have to use much water, but he still uses some because anyone that rides @NUM1 miles on a bike will need plenty of water no matter what the terrain is like. The features of the setting affect the cyclist toward the middle and end of his trip greatly because it gets rough and hilly and so he needs more water that he doesn’t have. And since he was planning on being able to get water at the first stop he didn’t conserve it as well, so this left less water for him to have when he really needed it. He then became dehydrated after his first stop, and he didn’t get any more water there so it caused him to dehydrate. So it seem that the features of the setting affect the cyclist because when he has plenty of water and doesn’t really need it the terrain is smooth and easy to ride but as he drinks his water the terrain gets rougher and worse. So the features of the setting affects him greatly in that they don’t help him they just get worse when he needs it to get better.	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
7056	3	"After reading, Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit,” I noticed that the setting of this adventure affected the narrator. First of all, the heat cause the narrator to be uncomfortable and thirstier. While on the moving, he refers to the trip as a ,”water-deplating” one this quote shows that he was lacking water and that this was a major problem. Also it refers to the road as “rolling hills"", and this shows the reader that they seem to go on forever. This lowers the narrator’s hope of getting there quickly. Also the desert gives the author low hope of reaching his destination. The setting affects the narrator both physically and mentally."	2.0	3.0		3.0																					
7059	3	Many features of the setting affect the cyclist. First, he was in “high desert of California in June.” This affected him many ways. It makes him become very dehydrated. He had to conserve his water and chew on pebbles to get any spit to collect in his mouth. Also, the road became very rough. The new terrain made him has to push himself harder and lose energy quicker. The last feature would be the distance. He had to travel a lot further then he had planned to.

7065	3	The features of the setting  affect the cyclist in many ways. The setting was a dry California desert, for if it had been a busting city, the events in the story would have not happened. The author asked a group of old men for directions to Yosemite National Park, and , “like a foolish yuuth,” folluwed their advice. Everything started out fine until he reached the second town. He –ans almost dehydrated and “in an ironic twist” he reached on abandoned grape juice foctary. Almost all hope was lost for him until he rounded the bend and came across his new hope: “Gary and Wilber’s Fish camp-if you wont bait pur the big ones, we’re your best bet “ in He end he learned tostick to a map instead of old people who “haven’t left the confines of their purchess,hce carter was ,h office”	3.0	3.0		3.0

Sometimes life can be so cruel.” In the horrible @NUM3 degree heat the narrator gulps down his water bottles at such a rate that he’s at risk of running out. Not only that but he’s been pedaling for such a long time that he @MONTH1 pass out from exaustion or,.” I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadnt been off their porch in decades.” So I would say the narrator was pretty hasseled by his surroundings.

7082	3	The cyclist is riding through the high deserts in California. In this environment everything looks the same for miles. The cyclist is dehydrated and is getting worse because he has no protection from the sun. It is hard for the cyclist to keep in good spirits because he is not even coming across any towns or sources of water. The cyclist says “About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first ‘town.’ This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time- say before the last world war- but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.” This made the cyclist doubt the old timers directions. In the wide open desert, the cyclist was only coming across something after at least twenty miles. The heat, lack of water, and lack of civilization made the cyclist think he was “going to die and the birds would pick [him] clean.

7107	3	"The features of the barren desert path make the cyclist quite nervous, but they also make him determined to escape them. He passes “ghost towns,” “abandoned buildings,” and diamondback snakes. These are images traditionally associated with being lost in the deserts, and would be enough to instill fear in most anyone travelling alone. The author even remarks that sadists are probably finding his story pleasing. He often mentions fears of “dropping” dead, being eaten by vultures, and, at one point, even wishing death upon himself via choking albeit jokingly. And yet he was determined to live. In spite of the odds stacked against him, he moved on, even after losing “what (he) believed to be (his) lost burst energy."" He even maintains a sense of humor throughout, writing of a diary entry that would be left behind that remarks on the wisdom of old men.

""I chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on."" The cyclist is still thinking positively at this point in the essay. A while later, the cyclist comes across another abandoned set of buildings. He feels that this sight is ""troubling."" @CAPS1 the cyclist is worried, he is not yet depressive and pessimistic.

7126	3	Some features of the setting that affect the cyclist is he is riding a bike through the dessert. He says “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” So he was scortching hot peddling a bike. The road became bumpy and curry. A sign had said “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted Speed limit. The speed limit was @NUM1 and he was going @NUM2 so it must have been hard to get over all the bumps. The lastly he comes across and poisioness snake blocked the majority of the pavement infront of me.” So him dehydrated trying to get ground a snake would be terrifying.

The terrain starts working against him in his search for water, “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills a large high way sign jumped out at he.

The ability to block all of that out and trying to focus on something easier to handle is exactly what you want to do in these situations, @CAPS3 terrain can really build character into a cyclist, but  adding the fact the amount of water he had and the dryness around him, it sounds like torture.

7131	3	The cyclist, Joe Kurmaskie, had a rough time traveling to Yosemite @ORGANIZATION1’l Park. Granted he was misled, but if the conditions of the terrain and if the climate were working for him it wouldve made life a whole lot easier. Not only was it hot, being in a desert in California in June, but he only had one water bottle. One water bottle @MONTH1 have lasted a little longer if it was a straight shot through, but it wasn’t. The roads went up, down, there were hills, there were towns-ghost towns at that. The only water he could pump from the pump was scalding hot and tasted acidic. Also, he wouldn’t have lost as much energy if it was a straight shot. It’s easy to say that he literally roughed it, having to resort to putting rocks in his mouth to circulate saliva. All in all, he was very determined to work through the very unfortunate conditions he had working against him, and very lucky to survive it. 	2.0	3.0		3.0																					
7139	3	Features of the setting affect the cyclist in a great way His journey would not be as difficult if these factors had not crossed his path. Climate, location, and population all have an effect on the cyclist. In the story, it is told that the cyclist is in the dry climate in California, in the heat of June.Their is also a lack of water, some must pace his sips carefully. Therefore also few towns, making it hard to get good advice and supplies and supplies. The cyclsit also comes across a snake, making him affected by native wild life.  The dry climate and lack of water affects him by having doubt. The cyclist is constantly worried about passing out and dying of dehydration. The cyclist also gets doubts when he sees the road signs reminding him how slow he is going. The snake also has a depressing effect about his dangers on his journey. All of these things in the setting affected the cyclist. His journey does teach you though, that trough determination you will be rewarded. You have to want things bad enough and put the effort into it. The author also teaches you to always have a positive attitude to get success.	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
7144	3	The setting affects the cyclist mood in the story the cyclist takes a short cut with many abandon towns, and buildings as well as a bumpy, terrain. When he came to a fork in his path that had a water pump he immediately began to pump it the water was not good for drinking. He was determined to make it to the next town. “I could make that” he said. Because of the ghost town and the old pump he had to continue on. When the cyclist came to a sign in the road warning him about the road a hed he began to get depressed, “I was sad”. Finally when he reached @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 Fish Camp he was thankful and wanted to show his gratitude. The setting can affect a cyclist by his mood at first the cyclist is determined but as the setting gets worse his mood and hopes go down the drain. At the end when the setting is bright so is his mood.	2.0	3.0		3.0																					
7147	3	Alot of factors effected the cyclist. Temperature, terrain, directions all gave the cyclist doubt. The temperature through the high deserts of california left the cyclist feeling hot, parched and irratable. Through the story, he had all but a few slips of his water left. Knowing your running low of water “to feel sorry for himself” The cyclist had biked so far the terrain started to change from flat to “rolling hills”. This could impact someone greatly who has never biked on different levals before. Lastly, the feeling of hoped could have effected him the most. Not believing in yourself is the hardest thing to overcome. Having just liesurly taken instructions by an old man cost the cyclist hours of torture. The author did a great job using hyperbole to exagerate the cyclists feeling of lost hope . He also used very detailed text to paint the reader a picture. These literay elements made it easier for me to understand the effect of the temp, terrain and hope had on the biclist.	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
7149	3	In the short story, “Do Not Exceed Posted speed limit,” by Joe Kurmaskie, expresses the features of the setting like the lack of water, and can not find help to the end affects the cyclist in the story. During his time of need the cyclist says, “It didn’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some expensive outdoor gear and a diary with the last entry in praise old men their wisdom.” The cyclist has a lack of necessities in the features around him and is letting his pride fall down; giving up on hope. When the cyclist finds hope, “And drank deeply from the sink, I had an overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them, and buy some bait.” The cyclist was astonished of what he had stumbled onto and appreciated that he was still alive. The cyclist should not have taken the old peoples advice for granted, but will now look onto people’s sense of directions.	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
7151	3	The setting in the story was the “high deserts of California in June.” At first the cyclist had seemed really confident and excited about his journey. It was during it that had changed his mind. The cyclist was running low on his water supply's so he stops and pumps water from this water pump but all he gets is this acid taste. So he is on his way to the nearest town which is @NUM1 miles away and he thinks he can make it. So he is heading towards the nearest town when the terrain starts changing. It changes from flat road to short rolling hills. During this time the cyclist starts loosing hope. He thinks that he is going to die of dehydration and the birds are going to pick him apart. Then when he thought he couldn’t make it he saw a sign that said “Gary and @CAPS1 fish camp” He ran into the shop and took long drinks from the sink in the bathroom and when he went out of the store an older gentle men asked him if he needed help and he said no I have a really good map. The thot temperature and rolling hills have a negative effect on the cyclist. I mean he goes from being confident to thinking he is seeing mirages and dieing. It states in the story “I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage” and “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean” So this brought self doubting behavior. 	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
7153	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in more than one way. The first features were a ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mule. These items gave the cyclist a feeling of doubts. They made him begin to think he had taken the wrong route when he saw these things were outdated. Then, he couldn’t get any cold,clean water out of the pumps to save his life. This was the first obstacle which affected him. The next features of the setting which caused a problem were the tumbleweeds and ""a ridiculously large snake.” They made the cyclist scared and caused him to go around these things. You can tell he wass scared because he quoted “I eased past.” When the flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills, the cyclist’s journey became exhausting,never ending, and difficult. Two more things affected the cyclist. These two things consist of the signs. One of which read “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" and the other “GARY AND WILBER'S FISH-IF you want bait for the big ones, we’re your BEST BET.""The first sign affected him in a negative way and caused him to become a little angry and frustrated because he was tired and dehydrated and the rough road ahead gave him no hope.

The author wrote, “I tolld on""(Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist was pushing through the rough and it was not an easy stretch to get through. Another place in the cyclist's trip that was difficult was when he saw the abandoned juice factory. The narration states, “over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view""(Kurmaskie @NUM1).

7155	3	The cyclist had experienced some hard obstacles on his ride to Yosemite. He had gotten directions from a group of old men who haden’t gone the places they told him about in a long time. Where they said there would be a town it was more like a ghost town. The day that the cyclist was riding was very hot and he was riding through the desert, @CAPS1 made it worse. Because of the heat he was drinking his water regularly to stay hydrated. This meant he was running out of it fast since the old men had given him directions through places that were no longer open he couldn’t get more water. The cyclist also had to go over roads that were in bad condition @CAPS1 slowed him down even more. Those features at the setting affected the cyclist a lot on his trip.	2.0	3.0		3.0																					
7159	3	In the story “Do not exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting affected the cyclist a lot. At first, when the cyclist set off in the morning, the conditions were great. It was breezy with shade from trees and rivers. Then, after a few hours, the cyclist was in the desert with bumpy hills. In the story, the speaker states, “Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” The condition of the roads and not having water really affected the cyclist. It took more energy to get up and down the hills without any shade which ment that he needed more water which he didn’t have any. The condition of the setting really affect the cyclist and if it was easier to bike, they might have not be so dehydrated.	3.0	3.0		3.0

7165	3	A cyclist is affected by many things when riding, most being features of the setting. One feature of the setting that can have an affect is the terrain. If the terrain is rough then the cyclist could have a more difficult time maintaining control of the bike, especially if he is not a professional rider. For example, the author of the essay on page @NUM1 titled: Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit, had a hard times on the rougher roads partly due to his level of experience. Another aspect of the environment that can have an affect on a cyclist is the climate. Most people who go cycling ??? know anything about the sport know how to dress for it to keep their body at a comfortable temperature but sometimes the weather plays tricks  on us. The cyclist could get caught in a sudden heat wave to drop in temperature.	3.0	2.0		3.0

First of all as he was riding about @NUM1 miles up the road, he saw that the terrain was changing and that scared him, he says “This sight was troubling. I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly “(kurmaskie @NUM2). He is saying that as the things around him began to change the more he got scared. And he kept drinking a lot of water just to bring down his fear. Another example is after he had left the sign that told him not to pass. He says “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills"" (kurmaskie @NUM3). This is also an example of fear that started over coming him, when he saw even more changes. He wasn’t going to stop because of the road changes and the fact that his water was almost gone he still had the courage to go further. The setting brought him fear but he made it through."	2.0	3.0		3.0

The features of the setting affected the cyclist by having no water to drink because it was a desert there was no vegetation that means there is no water so he was becoming dehydrated. Also the setting of the towns he went to had no living organisms or people so he also couldn’t quench his thirst there. In one town there was a spiket but the water was gross and hasn’t been pumped in a while. Then he comes to the Welch’s juice factory which was abandoned and from there he thought he was done for but then he finally come to a shop were there are bathrooms were he drinks water from the sink and he is relieved. Also the rocky roads affected him because he barely had any water left, and rocky tent to take more strength and endurance.	2.0	3.0		3.0																					
7174	3	"In the passage DO Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit the desert’s feature did not have any positive affects on the cyclist. The desert contained ""rolling hills."" When a cyclist goes over hills it takes more energy due to the laws of gravity. Because the cyclist used more energy to go over the hills he only had enough energy to ""feel sorry"" for himself. The more hills, the more energy lost, the more tired he became. The desert was also hot, and dry. Obviously, since he was in the ""deserts of California in June."" @CAPS1 the would make him become thirsty. He did stop for water but a ""tarlike substance"" came out instead. When he again stopped later for water it was ""cool"" and most likely refreshing. Riding his bike in the hilly, dry, hot desert the cyclist became tired and thirsty."	3.0	2.0		3.0

7183	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” many of the features of the setting affect the cyclist on his journey. The rusty water pump, highway sign and abandoned juice factory all seemed to make his trip more difficult than it already was. First of all, when the author stumbles along a “ramshackle shed” surrounded by “several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lames mule”, he is anylous to check the pump for well-needed water. When he finds that he is out of luck and cannot drink the bitter tasting water, his hope droop a little. It is as if the sun were taunting him, telling him that he can’t make it. Secondly, he passes a large road sign reading “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”. Once again he begins to feel hopeless, but then turns his angst into determination to finish his journey. He says “sometimes life can be so cruel” as he notices the speed limit to be @NUM1, but he continues on, pedaling hard. Lastly, the author sees a lone building in the distance and almost doesn’t believe his eyes. It turns out to be not only his last hope for water, but an abandoned grape juice factory. He reflect on the irony of his position by saying that his situation “should please all sadists” reading about it. Therefore, the features of the setting affected the reader by highlighting the negativity of his situation, which in turn drives him to continue pedaling.	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
7185	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in several ways. First the rolling hills make it hard to pedal over the land. ""Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,"" shows that the terrain was changing into a more difficult course. One long crippling hill,"" also shows how the hills had an effect on the cyclist. Another feature of the setting was the desert and the high temperatures. This caused the cyclist to become dehydrated. ""Trying to keep balance in my dehydrated state"" and ""I could drop from heatstroke"" show me how hot the cyclist was. One final feature that has on effect on the cyclist was the old abandoned factory. The sight of the boy with a refreshing glass of juice makes the cyclist lose hope and he doubts he will survive. ""I hung my head"" and ""abandoned factory of juices and dreams"" tell how the cyclist lost all hope at the sight of the building. All of these features of the setting have negative affects on the cyclist."	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
7187	3	There are several features of the setting which affect the cyclist one is the fact that he is traveling on a hot day in June. “and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.” The heat was getting to the cyclist and he was scared he might get heatstroke. The terrain was also not very ideal for a cyclist on a hot @DATE1. “I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” The cyclist was tired and the hills were making it worse. “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” The cyclist was running out of water quickly and there was nowhere close to get more. These glitches in the setting affected the cyclist because it was extremely hot, he was running out of water and there was rough terrain. The setting was not in the cyclist's favor.	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
7188	3	According to the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit'' the features of the setting affect the cyclist a lot. One way the features of the setting affects the cyclist is that the mountains make the cyclist more tired. Especially because he no water, then having to go up and down hills really wears the cyclist out and causing him to lead into dehydration faster. The features of the setting affected him in that sense. Also the snake affected the cyclist. The snake caused the cyclist to be afraid which added to the fact that the cyclist was dehydrating. Another way that the features of the setting affected the cyclist was the Welch's Grape Juice Factory. The factory caused the cyclist to be even more thirsty and think about dehydration even more in the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the features of setting affect the cyclist a lot.	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
7197	3	There are several features of the setting that greatly affect the cyclist. One feature is the desert he is biking through. The heat of a desert in June can easily dehydrate someone. When exposed for a long time, exercising, and running out of water, the effect is even greater. In addition, the change in terrain and road surface would have an effect on the cyclist. Traveling on a flat road requires much less effort then climbing hills. If the road is also rough, the biker has to work even harder to push the up the hill. There is also the mental effort of not tipping the bike on the uneven surface. Finally, there are not any buildings in sight. When someone is dehydrated but has no water, they are desperate to find some. However, if there is nothing they know of nearby, they will start to lose hope. Once they lose hope they won’t try as hard to keep going and they will lose some of their strength. Considering all of the things negatively affecting the cyclist, it is amazing that he managed to push through and reach a source of water. 	2.0	3.0		3.0																					
7204	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because they change the cyclist’s mood towards the rider. For example, in the essay “Rough Road Ahead;Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” it states, ""There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or sructure of any kind. I began breaking the ride clan into distances I could see on the horizon” The cyclist had to do this because they were having trouble riding since they were thirsty and the ride was very boring. This makes the ride seem larges so it also makes it harder to ride. Also in the essay it states, ""One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps” This affeted the cyclist because after seeing this and later realizing he could’t drink the water, he was more thirsty since he was running out of water. When the cyclist notices the Welch‘s grape juice factory, he bacames determined to get there. In conclusion, the cyclist in the essay “Rough Road Ahead"" by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist mood towards the ride is strongly affected by the setting’s features."	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
7209	3	There are many ways the cyclist is affected throughout the essay by the setting. As he first enters the “short cut” that the old men give him he is confidenc. When he arrives at the first town and sees that it is like a ghost town he does not fret but continues on his journey in confidence. As he got to the second stop his lack of water began to set in, “I got down on my hands and knees working the handle of the rusted water with all my strength. This shows he will work hard and is in need of water. As the cyclist past another place with no hope of water he placed stones in his mouth because he once heard it helped get your mind off thirst when he had just about lost hope from travelling through the hot @CAPS1 desert with no water he found one lost drive in him when he saw a store with water. Though this was a hot harsh setting it created inspiration for him to keep going and push through the hard times and survive.	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
7211	3	The features of the setting had greatly impacted the cyclist. The heat, animals, and terrain had slowed him down throught his journey. The heat had slowed him down because he didn’t have enough water to keep his boby moving normaly, and he said he had slowed him down because he had to sneak around it so it wouldn’t bite him. The hills had affected the cyclist because it takes a lot of energy to go up there, when he said he couldn’t see anything in sight.	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
7212	3	"The arid, bare, and rough terrain of the desert affected the cyclist during his journey to Yosemite in the story “Rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit”. The cyclist’s expedition was hindered due to many obstacles. The dryness was a huge problem during his journey. “.I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June"" (Kurmaskie @NUM1). This exert explain the hot, arid climate of where he was cycling. This climate decreased the rate of travel the cyclist intended to exert. Since the cyclist was riding in the desert, there wasn’t many towns present. When the cyclist did approach a town, it was abandoned. “One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mule greeted me” (@NUM2). After riding through the desert, the cyclist would have wanted a nice rest stop, but all of them were ghost towns. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills “(@NUM1). Cycling for hours in a hot desert with limited water wasn’t enough of a challenge; the flat land was replaced with hills. The cyclist is exhausted from all the other obstacles that the desert confronted him with; the rough terrain affected his journey since his rate was reduced.

7217	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, there were many features of the setting that affected the cyclcist. The first feature that affected the cyclist was the desert terain, it very hot and there were no trees to provide shade. This affected the cyclist because he got very hot and thirsty. So he drank more water than usual. Secondly, he was running out of water because he was drinking more than usual so he had to conserve his water, which was making him became dehydrated. That all the towns we past through were ghost towns with no running fresh water, so this extremely dissapointed him, it also furthered his dehydration. Just when the cyclist was losing hope he found a small bait shop and got into the shade and finnaly got water to drink. So after all those dissapointments he found hope, in the small bait shop, which gave him the strength and mental boost to continue on with his journey to Yosemite national park.	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
7218	3	The features of the setting made the cyclist’s journey even longer and more strenuous. The reason it being in such a remote area did not help. For example the people who still lived in that remote area were probably as old as the cyclist grandparents and the directions were horrible. Also, the fact that their were no new shops or areas or rest for the cyclist to go to; the water pump he found was old and nasty and the only building he saw was abandoned. Also ther factor was the rough terrain. It  being froit the cyclist was already very fatigued by lack of water and tiredness the terrain was long, bumpy and just horrible all together. Finally, the last factor was where he was bicycling in California on a @CAPS1 summer day and he being on a which had no n.c(but which bike does) did not help at all. These are how the features affect the cyclist journey.	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
7222	3	"In the adventures of the cyclist the setting is not only what developes the character but, that what affects how he pushes himself to not give up, even when he feels helpless. This is one example of how the cyclist is affected, ""I had been hitting my water bottles pretty reguarly and I was traveling through the high desert of California in June,"" With that information you can observe how this harsh setting creates problems for him physicaly because his body needs water. Which he is extremely limited and doesn't savor it very well. These issues create the problem of dehydration, and when mentally you think your going to die without water. You start to panic and lose control over yourself."	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
7224	3	In ''Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted speed Limit'' by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting most the time disappoint him. You can tell that the features of the setting disappointed him because every time he got to a town he couldn’t get water. In the text it states, ''I got down on my hands & knees working the handle of the rusty water pump a for like substance oozed out followed by @NUM1 degree brackish water that tasted like battery acid.’’ You know the setting disappoints him when he sees the terrain he has to cross as well. You can tell who he says ''At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path a ridicuously large snake.'' The narrarator was disappointed that he listened to the directions of the elder rather than use his map. Joe Kurmaskie does a great job of making one narrarator faced & how he felt about them.	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
7229	3	The features of the setting have a very negative effect on the cyclist. According to the old men the cyclist would pass by a few towns if he took the route they told him. But every town the cyclist came to was deserted. “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” Because the towns were deserted, the cyclist water supply was dwindling because there was no place where he could get more water. He became dehydrated and kept pushing himself to find a place where there was fresh water. “Trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” Once he found some pebble and thought about sucking on them because it helps to slow down dehydration. But he didn’t because he thought he would choke on them. The setting around him also made him have negative thoughts. “It didn’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” Because the setting was a hot, deserted, desert it had a very negative effect on the cyclist. If he hadn’t been running out of water I don’t think that the effect of the setting would have been as bad. But because he did run out of water it made the effects much worse.	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
7231	3	"It is said that, ""experience is a good substitute for @CAPS1 instinct.” This means if someone knows how to deal with the environment they're in they can survive even if they weren't born with the animal instinct that come with the territory. However, even the most experienced person can be overcome by the extreme weather conditions they live in. In the essay, ""Rough Road Ahead,” by Joe Kurmaskie, the experienced cyclist decides to take a long, difficult, and dangerous trip. His ride will take him a long the long desert paths of California with a limited water supply. This is the major element that and him in the story. Because he listened to same old men he went without water for most of his trip. Between his constant excersise, extreme heat, and lack of water, dehydration hit him fast. A common side effect of dehydration is hallucination, which the cyclist knew. It says in the essay, “I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn`t mirage.” This represents his knowledge and experience in the matter, and showed that he was adapt to his environment through experience. A similar story to this is jack @LOCATION2's, “To @CAPS2 a fire” where the man is also pitted against extremes at nature through the vukor, but the elements still ovetook him.

The rough terrain also led to her using own strength to get up and down hills, and to get plants and animals. The settings in the story led the cyclist to become dehydrated and weak, she was forced on as low supply of water and dodge numerous hazards, with no sign of living people near her. “This place might have been a thrivins little spot at one time say, before the last world was"" This suggests a ghost town, where no people were currently living.

7256	3	In the essay, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” a cyclist is confronted with a troubling setting on his journy to Yosemite. He is led away from the steady road as a result of taking mislead advice from an old group of individuals. In this essay the setting plays a crucial impact on the cyclist. In the essay, the author sets up the story describing the day as, “traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” Because of the amount of heat the cyclist was enduring, he became weary and dehydrated. Alone with this, the cyclist had to work much harder because the man noticed, “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” This setting is a major setback to the cyclist’s journy, and required him to persevere. In my life there have been numerous obstacles which I have had to persevere through. One of which had been when I was out camping, and suddenly, as in the essay, the setting changed, and a storm came. Though the other campers and I did what we needed to to make the best outof it. In the essay, the cyclist is affected greatly by the setting. This was the same in my experience as the setting affected myself. In both situations, perserverance led to a final satisfaction of the journey.	3.0	3.0		3.0

The cyclist encouraged himself to keep going, just to find an open building. “…telling myself that if I could make it that far, I’d be fine.” @CAPS1 many abandoned factories, the cyclist tried many methods to decrease his thirst including sucking on stones. “…slowly gaining elevation while losing hope.” @CAPS2 the cyclist found a deserted building, he lost more and more hope. When the cyclist found open store with modern bathrooms, he had “an overwhelming urge to seek out @PERSON1, kiss them, and buy some bait.” At the end the cyclist promised himself to always use his map.	2.0	3.0		3.0																					
7271	3	In the short story “Do not exceed posted speed limit” the settings of the story affect the cyclist. They make him think he will die and overall make him worried. In the story the cyclist takes two old men’s advice on the best way to get to Yosemite mountin and gets himself in the middle of nowhere. He finds himself in the California desert without water, he lets this go to his head. “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” That line was from the last page of the story. The biker was taking an unfamiliar route and he let himself believe he would die. He knew he was in the desert without water the setting makes him nervous because he was in a desert. He wouldn’t have been nearly as nervous if he was in a forest where there are streams. He lets the desert and the heat convince that he is going to die. By coming across ghost towns he believes he will never see anothe person again, he gets oledrar because of where he is. He thinks the heat will kill him. The setting affects him and tricks him into believing he is going to die.	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
7272	3	The feature of the setting including the conditions, weather, and amount of water can possibly decide the life or death of the cyclist. The conditions such as hills, and rocky roads can decied a future for a cyclist because if the rocky roads turn you off balance you could fall down a hill and give yourself an injury or possibly die. For example, in the short-story it says, “over one long crippling hill, a building came into view” This shows the conditions in which the cyclist had to deal with. In addition, the weather and amount os water can also decide the future. “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke.” This shows us that if the cyclist gets dehydrated enough he could pass out and no one would find him in the desert. In addition, the heat isn’t helping him out any once he could die without anyone knowing. These reasons show us a cyclist needs to make sure they have enough water and the conditons and weather is right so they don’t make a life-threating choice.	3.0	2.0		3.0

However, once he notice that everything is not has the men said, he seems to grow a little angry and upset, @CAPS2 like the land seemed to reflect this soon he found himself in a bumby and unpleasant road. The setting also seemed to give the man more obstacles to overcome on adventure” tumbleweeds crossed my path a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the movement in front as me.” The land seemed to be leasing and tormenting him, when he started to figure out that listening to the old men was a mistake.    	3.0	3.0		3.0

Then when the cyclist rode upon that old shed and the rusty water pumps he began to feel a little worried because he was running out of water and The Old Timers never mentioned the shed. When the cyclist encountered the rolling hills with tumbleweeds and snakes I believe he began to feel dismayed because he was lost. I believe this because in the text he says ""I was going to die and the birds would pick me dead."" This shows how hopeless the man fealt. when he reached ""Gary and @CAPS1 fish camp"" he was relieved and thankfull because he no longer had death blazing towands him in the form of a yellow sun, empty spaces, and empty water bottle.

The terrain he had to go through was unbearable and could almost kill him without water. Luckily he had faith and determined so he got through it and learned a lesion.

The heat of the weather and lack of water makes the cyclist develop an uncaring matter. “I’d read once that sucking on stones helps…with any luck I’d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat.” The verbal irony in this passage delivers a negative feeling to the reader and it is here that it is clear that the cyclist doesn’t care what happens to him.

Prior to following the men’s directions, the setting was enjoyable a made for an easy ride a reader knows this because the cyclist is confident. For example, he says “The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it. The cool pines and rushing rivers of yosemite had my name written all over them.” This confidence begins to depleat as the cycling gets harder. For example, the cyclist says “sometimes life can feel so cruel.” after he hits rolling hills and a sign warning of rough road and not exceeding the speed limit. The cyclist became disappointed and wanted to give up because he couldn’t even reach that limit. However, he’s determined and pushes through to reach a shop. This gives a sense of satisfaction and confidence. So in conclusion setting can have a powerful affect on mood or motivation.	3.0	2.0		3.0

Then he comes to the first town which was a ghost town, that didn't really dampen his spirits because when he sees it he laughs. Also when the setting changes so does his confidence in the old men's direction giving. Like at the first town he still has confidence in what they told him. Then he notices that it starting to get hotter but that doesn’t change his mood much. @NUM1 miles later comes top a fork in road with rusty water pumps and a ran down car all that makes him less confidence in water level. Then he realizes the next town is a long way away so he losse more confidence and gets more worried about water. Then the flat road is replaced with rough road so his mood goes down more. Then at last he goes to a fishing store and so he gets water and his spirits go way up. Here is how the setting affected his mood.	2.0	3.0		3.0																					
7315	3	The features of the setting greatly affect this cyclist. At first he is fine riding along the old-timers “shortcut” as he states that “things began well enough. I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.” But what he didn’t know was this was the beginning of a very rough day. He arrived at the first “town” which was a ghost town. He wasn’t overly worried yet but at about sixty miles in on his journey he came to a ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a broken down corral. The cyclist explains how he had drank a lot of his water and was in need of some. He tried the pumps but he explains how “a far like substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” A couple miles later he came to a highway sign that read ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT. The cyclist continued on desperate for water. He even came across a snake. He was now fearing a heat stroke. He came to an abandoned grape juice factory and hung his head. The cyclist then was almost completely dehydrated from the long, tiring bike rid. The cyclist was sure he was going to die from dehydration or a heatstroke that this terrible ride had caused. He finally came to a shop a drank from the sink. So this ride was torturous due to the setting.	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
7319	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making him dehydrated, troubled, and relieved. The cyclist is dehydrated because of the horrible heat. He says “the growing realie at von that l would drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.” This means that the heat is a treat to him and would cause him to become dehydrated and have heatstroke. The cyclist is troubled by the scarce sourroundings. ""a corral that couldn’t hold the lamest mule.” He is getting worried because there is no one around and his directions are starting to sound wrong. The cyclist is relieved by the water from the sink. He had the “overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them.” This means that that he is so relieved that he has finally found water and he wants to thanks the owners of the bait shop for providing it."	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
7332	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in these ways. The cyclist was very hot. “wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt and the growing realization that I could drop from heartsroke on a gorgeous day in June.” The towns that passed through that were supposed to have people were in fact deserted. His ride ended up being even harder than it would have been. This is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	2.0	2.0		3.0																					
7335	3	One of the biggest problems that the author faced in his essay was his surroundings. The setting of the story in Yosemite provided many obstacles such as the vastness of the park, the summer heat, and the fact that many places had been abandoned. The summer heat was the biggest problem for the cyclist. He had to bike many miles, but he only had limited supply of water. Eventually, his water supply began to run low, which increased his determination to find the next town before he collapsed. It is this determination which moves him from ghost town to ghost town and keeps the story moving. Another big problem was the vastness of Yosemite National Park, which he was biking through. Any wrong turns (which he took, thanks to the direction he was given) could get him lost and thrown off track for a very long time. It was his confusion as to where the next time was that kept him biking, with difficulty and made for an interesting story. An example of the vastness of the park was when he quote, “About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first ‘town.’ This place might have been a thriving spot at one time-say, before the last world war-but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.” This quote shows that even after many miles, he hadn’t seen a sign of anyone living, which would have increased his desperation to keep looking for civilization.	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
7336	3	In ''Do Not Exceed Speed Limit,'' by Joe Kurmaskie, the author depicts the vivid details of the setting and how they contribute to the cyclist’s condition. For example, the author wrote “Over one long, crippling hill, a building come into view. I wiped the sweat from my eye” The way the author described the hill as “crippling” should how much energy it was taking away from the cyclist. Another quote that contributed to the cyclist’s journey was, “that smoky blues tune ''Summer time” rattled around in the dry honeycombs of my deteriorating brain.” This expressed how dehydrated the summer heat way making him. I believe the author used modifying details to support the description of the cyclist’s condition. I think the description of the setting enhanced the reader’s perception of the cyclist’s journey.   	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
7344	3	The features of the setting in, “Rough Road Ahead” negatively affect the cyclist. In the California desert, water is everything. If you run out of water then you might as well have run out of life. Without water, dehydration kicks in and it affects not only your body, but your mind too. The cyclist only had a limited amount of water with him when he started. ”I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.“ Through the deserted towns he came across, he searched for a source of water but found none that were useable.” When I tried a drop or two ,it had the flower of battery acid.” @CAPS1 feature was the heat. It began to mess with his mind and take toll on his body quickly.” I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage” He worned about heatstroke and his bodys need for water throughout the entire trip. Finally, in the deserts of California, wildlife can affect you. The cyclist was using a path that nature had claimed  and was not traveled often by people “ crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement.” As you can see, the cyclist was negatively afftected by the features of the setting in, “Rough Road Ahead.”	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
7354	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist’s attitude towards the old men. Since the cyclist listened to the old mens directions he was furious with himself. Seeing that the last attempt of direction had caused the cyclist to become nearly delicious, the setting had added severly to the problem. The beating sun and high desserts in California in the middle of June made the cyclist dehydrated and tired. When he come to a rusted water pump “black tar oozed out, you can picture the cyclist as furious and anxious and of course thirsty. The rough terrain and tumble weeds had caused the cyclist to feel skeptical of his decision to follow the old mens-directions.	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
7355	3	The cyclist in “Rough Road @CAPS1; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” starts off in the “serenity of an easly summer evening” taking road advice from old-timers. At first when the sun was beating down on him, he didn’t mind; the thoughts of Yosemite kept him determined. Later however, his determination was fading as he realized that his “short cut” was not so short after all. The “high deserts of California in June” and the terrain changed furthered his dehydration and need to find water. The emptiness of his surrounding with “no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind” made him focus on the horizon and tell himself that if he made it there, the he’d be alright. Finally, a building came into view. The hope he got from this gave him strength to move on. Ironically it was an abandoned building. The cyclist describes it as a “Welch’s Grape Juice factory and bottling plant.” @CAPS2 this he had lost hope and hung his head. Believing he was going to die, the cyclist got back on his bike. Driving away from the factory, he saw a sight of a fish camp and immediately regained hope. Going there, he regained his strength and learned his lesson, never take road advice from other people.  	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
7361	3	The cyclist see his journey affect by a succesion of events that will make his journey trave?? every time more difficul and difficult. One of the first errors his makes is take advice from people that have no clue of where there are at. @CAPS1 (I shouldn't have done was let them have a peek at my map.) The temperature of the desert also influenced him (I was travelling through high desert of California). The  cyclist also finds his' self with a combination of emotions at times he thinks he is going to past away and at times he believes he will be fine. (@CAPS1 @NUM1) As i stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drunk deeply from the sink, I thought i had a over whelming wigs to seek Gary.	2.0	3.0		3.0																					
7364	3	In the story the cyclist is on a bike ride to @LOCATION1. He has a new map is doing very well, until he asks these old men the best way to get there taking less time and by getting these faster a.k.a a short at. He takes there directions and feels good abut it. But soon things change, he experiences new terrain and it becomes much harder. The type of setting that he faces are steep hills, speed limits that he can’t exceed, dry hot temperature, and he has no water. All these features combine together to make the situation worse. While he is experiencing these things he feels like he is going to die and feels like giving up. But eventually he finds someone and doesn’t ask for directions. So the lession is don’t take directions from a stranger unless your willing to face the unexpected. 	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
7366	3	The settings affect the cyclist in many ways on the way to Yosemite. Well for one when he took the shortcut, one thing that already made it difficult was that it was June, and he’s out in the desert. Also it says how he went to a couple towns that were deserted so there was no way to replenish his water. It says, “I pumped that handle for several minutes, but the water wouldn’t cool down. When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid.” @CAPS1 thing about his setting that changed was the hills.  But once he came to a bait shop, the old man asks  him if he  knows the best way to get to Yosemite, and he responds, “yes- sir: I own a very good map.” @CAPS2 by this he’s understood that the best way to travel anywhere is the path or road he knows because he’ll know what to expect. This is how the setting changed.	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
7371	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in the the short story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” The getting of the story is, “a reservoir campground outside of @CAPS1, California” during the early summer. Being the early summer in souther California, the temperatures are going to be hot. And the main character, who is a cyclist and is doing a lot of physical activity, is a going to sweat a lots. The temperature and excessive sweating cause the cyclist to drink a lot of water. The water runs out and we are now it our conflict. The setting also reads the main character to his resolution of the conflict. Being by a reserveir, fishing is going to be a popular activity. A bait and tackle shop would be the perfect business to have, since there who is at bait and tackle shop, the cyclist could go inside a quinch his thirst. Therefore, the setting of the story affect affects the conflict and the solution.	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
7372	3	The cyclist decided to ride to Yosemite National Park during a hot summer day in California. His first instincts was to use a perfectly good map that was up to date. Then he started having a conversation with some old me who decided that they would tell him a short cut they took back in the day. The cyclist decided to take the old’s men’s short cut through the desert with one meschy bottle of water. It was really hot out side and the sun was scorging down on his back while he was riding his bike. This made him hotter than he ??? and there was no shade are place for him to top and get some water. This made the trip harder for him because now he was focused on finding water and not on his ride. The settings of the cause effected the cyclist in many ways he was not prepared for the route, and the route he took was not biker friendly. If he would have took the route that was on the map then he would have know where he was and his ride would not have been affected by thoughts of slowing down to put rocks in the moth to reserve water or thoughts of finding water he would 	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
7373	3	"The cyclist a had rough time. The elements were against him. It was dry and hot and he had no water. In the text it says,""The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. ""This shows that he had hardly any water, and what he did have would only make him thirster. ""@CAPS1 weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake. ""It was obviously not and the quote maker you visualize a desert or colorado. The man was no one in sight not a building, car, or structure of any kind. He was saving up his energy and his water. He was starting to go a little crazy. The hills were killer for him, in the text it says ""over one long, crippling hill."" This show you now rough the conditions were because he told us in the begining that he is a cyclist. The biker hell a very rough time and the setting definity effects this. "	2.0	3.0		3.0																					
7381	3	The setting affects the cyclist in many ways. It makes him feel hopeful, determined, alone, and completely exhausted. The desert- like terrain leaves him feeling very tired and thirsty. The bumpy road is hard to pedal over, and the endless stretches of land make him feel as if the next town is years away. While travelling, the cyclist recalls “At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake . blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me” (Kurmaskie, @NUM1).The tumbleweeds are a symbol of dry desert death. They remind the cyclist he is completely alone in a vast stretch of sand and rocks. Were the snake in the path to poison him he’d not only under the beaty sun until some other unfortunate cyclist found him. However, later on when he sees the sign for Gary and Wilber’s fish camp, the hope is restored back to him. He is yet again determined because waiting somewhere near is the water he needs to keep him alive. In the end, the setting helped him to safely feel the hope deep inside of him.	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
7387	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. They affected his confidence, his energy, and his determination. In the beginning of the essay the cyclist is very confident. This is show when he says.” The cool pined and rushing rivers of yosemite has my name written all over them. This shows confidence because he knows he can make it to yosemite.When he runs out of water he begins to lose confidence and thinks he way die. Since he ran out of water because of the heat, his energy is also dropped. You know he’s running out of water when he says.“The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips.” @CAPS1, after lose of water and confidence; he actually had higher determination to make it to Yosemite. This is human nature because our bodies when into survivor mode and become determined to survive. As you can see the cyclist was affected in many ways by the features of the setting.	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
7389	3	In the story “Rough Road Ahead Do not exceed posted speeed limit,” the cyclist is affected by features of the setting. In the story it says “The sun was beginning to beat down. “This quote means that it was getting hotter and this was going to make it harder for the cyclist to ride. Another quote that states that the features of the setting affects the cyclist is “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” This means that the cyclist is cold not only going to have to deal with the heat, but he is also going to have to side-over hill after hill. Eventhough they @MONTH1 be small, rolling hills, it still takes alot of energy out of you to ride up and down hills repeatedly. A third quote that shows the setting affecting the cyclist is “I got down on my hands and knes, walking the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength. A tar like substance oozed out, followed  by brackish water feling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees “this quote means the cyclist is so desperate to get water, that he uses his small amount of strength left to try and get some water. When he finally does get some water, it first come out as an ooey substance then the water come out really hot. In conclusion, these have been examples of how the cyclist was affected by features of the setting. 	2.0	3.0		3.0																					
7391	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly because there was tough terrain. The heat had affected him greatly as well. He seemed that every where he would go, he couldn’t find anything, no buildings or people until he got that one town. In the story, “Rough Road Ahead;Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the cyclist qoutes.“At same point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake.” @CAPS1 your bike on the middle of the desert, not knowing which way to go and only seeing  harsher conditions can only give you no hope .He soon almost ran out of water only made things worst.The sun beating down on him and his mind playing tricks on him also, so with the cyclist , settings had alot to do with his journey.	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
7392	3	The features the cyclist experianced during his ride affect his body and mind. At first the cyclist was on flat graund, drinking plenty of water and without fear. But when he came to his second town, he became ton on water. This troubled him, but he was optomistic telling himself “the next town was only eighteen miles.” After this the road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” this started to trouble him. Dehydration started to set him and every hill was a challenge. Once out of water he sucked on pebbles and hopped it would “take your mind off of thirst.” When he finally made it, he was so relieved. Everything from dehydration, wich affects the body to lozing hope affected the cyclist on his ride	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
7396	3	In ‘Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaskie the main character faces a lot of trouble. First people give him the wrong directions. But, worst of all he has to travel a lot of mile on a bike through extreme temperatures. Going up and down hills and pedaling really hard. He doesn’t even have any cool water. As the character says, “…followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees (kurmaskie @NUM1). That kind of water didn’t help him either. It didn’t quench his thirst because it was so hot, he said it tasted like battery acid. But, finally he worked up his confidence and kept pedalig till he found a fish camp that had a bathroom with a sink that had cool water. Then he headed off to Yosemite and didn’t take anyone’s advice.	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
7401	3	Setting in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” really determines how the story turns out. The setting was in deserted areas, the desert, and even roadways. In the desert, there is no water making the cyclist become dehydrated. without water, he thought he was going to die. In the road areas, the speed limits was extremly high fifty-five miles per hour. This would not be good since he is doing  “ a water-depleting @NUM1.” When he finds areas that are abandoned, these are water pumps, but the liquid that comes out @MONTH1 be water, but it tastes like “battery acid.” Setting can affect alot in the story. Without this setting, the story would be alot different than it is now.	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
7405	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist a lot. First is the emptiness, the feeling that he is all alone. Nor a car, person  or building in sight. The fact that if something were to happen then there would be no way of telling anyone. That it would be along while before  anyone would be able to  find him. Nor that  might ecase some, But I think dalved him even more. It gave him that extra boost of energy that seems  to have come out of nowhere. Then there is the type of animal. The desert environment is very, unforgiving. The sun beats down like your only person on the plannet. The lack of water the food that it hasn’t rained in decades. The never ending, @CAPS1 road. The ups and downs and all the animals that await him. The fact that if he stops at all, ever, then a snake could easily bite him and that would be the end of it. These extreme conditions and the harsh environment that is explained in the text has alot to do with the cyclist and affects him a great deal.  	2.0	3.0		3.0																					
7407	3	The countries of the setting that had the most effect on the cyclist were the deserts and hills. The author tells us first of his depleting water supply as he journeys through the high deserts of California in June. “The hills had a major effect on him because the intensive host that any desert contains, with this heat, his limited water, and the fact that it was June. I’m sure the author was most a happy person traveling within his intensive journey. Another misfortune that the author explains is the touring changing.” That road was replaced by a host rolling hills. “With my own experience, I know these cannot be a worse kind. Tall steep hills are a difficult climb, but your a living house the luxurious most to cool. In his mind too with, the author’s “Short, rolling hills”, the climb gets more miserable with every hill, and the coast down the other side barely cools your bare skin, leaving your thiving soul to continue in this dep pain. I’m sure the cyclist was experiencing a burned out spirit after just a few of those deadly hills.    	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
7410	3	"The features of the setting extremely affect the adjust in the ride to the meet town. It was bad enough that the adjust the out of water but on top of that by faced, rolling wills, makes and hard road condition all of these setting played a huge will in the cyclist puformance, ""it motued the terrain changing. that way was replaced by that rolling hills."" He also says ""tumbleweed around my matt and a includesouly change snake it really did look like a demand luck blocked the majority of the movement in front of me. These setting made it difficult for the adjust to reform because the hills snakes and tumbleweed disturbed the adjust to advanced in the ride. He ran out of water no it was hard to reduce up will and the night of a deadly snake made the adjust named and worked to the difficulty of pufornenance for the cyclist"	2.0	3.0		3.0																					
7413	3	The features of the setting in “DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT” affect the cyclist in a negative way. The terrain goes from being very mild to rough and rolling. Considering that the author does not know the layout of this terrain very well, he begins to struggle. The author is very unsure of where to go and begins encountering obstacles such as, tumbleweed, snakes and lack of water. The fact that the author is running out of water, makes continuing on a very stressful. He is worried that he will die of dehydration before he ever reaches Yosemite National Park. Finally, with much strength and determination, he reaches a fish a Fish camp. He is able to fill his water supply and regain his strength before pressing on.	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
7415	3	The features of the settings affects the cyclist a lot in the passage called  “Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”. Cyclist are in very good physical shape. They can cycle for along time; however, weather can affect the cyclist. This happened in the passage. The cyclist was determined and confident he could make this journey. “I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or so- a test of my inner spirit. Even though he had confidence the features of the setting affected the cyclist. “Tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake….”. “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips”. The cyclist was tired and exhausted. The weather and terrain had worn him down. The weather can change my level of ability sometimes. I love to play basketball outside. When it is hot and humid out I can’t play as long. The features of a setting can clearly affect people.	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
7417	3	The settings affect the cyclist in more than one way. These ways are that he is running out of water, he might become dehydrated and he is unsure of the path he is on. With him running out of water, he is in real trouble. Because of the lack of water, not only might be die but he begins to see mirages. His lack of water eventually leads to dehydration and he become uneasy about things. For example; in the text it says that he staggered into the store. Because he is unsure of the path he is on, he begins to panic a little. Panicing isn’t good especially considering that he is running low on water and is becoming dehydrated. Panic can’t help to solve anything. The setting is in a dessert so he needs lets of water, which he runs low on. Desserts are extremly hot which causes a person to become dehydrated or die. Desserts have little shade, if any; and they have rough weather as well as rough landscape. For example, they’re landscape is mostly all hot sand. Therefore, the setting does affect the cyclist.	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
7419	3	"In the story “Rough Road Ahead” the features of the setting affect the cyclist. At points the setting mode the author feel depressed and sad and at other times, happy and joyful. For example, the cyclist was pedaling and pedaling with nothing in sight. In twenty miles he saw camp ?? a ?? that he was thirsty and had holes. When he pumped the water, no  come out. These part of the setting gave the cyclist a bad affect. The cyclist gave ""teaches life can be so cruel"" He obviously had a bad effect if he thought life was being cruel At some point in the story the setting be a good affect on the reader. He is able to die of thirst when he sees a bait shop. This puts the cyclist in a good mood because he said “my troubles thirst and feels he all behind me” different settings in the story gave the author a different affect. "	2.0	3.0		3.0																					
7420	3	The setting affected the cyclist because the terrain you ride on can determine how you ride. For instance when you have hills and dry weather like they did when it said “flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills” The one easy terrain was now made more difficult and only added to his frustration and his dehydration from having no water. Also the heat contributed plenty and it was there the whole time.  Sometimes he didn’t seem to notice or feel it but it was there and it was taking energy from him: Like when it said, “The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it.” He didn’t know it but that took from him so he drank more water and that affected his ability to take enough to complete the ride.	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
7424	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. He always kept his head up and was determined to make it to his destination. The first problem was when he came to the “fork of sorts” as he put it. He needed more water, but the pumps were rusty and all he could get out of them was a tarlike substance followed by blackish water. He tested it, hoping it was better than it looked, but it wasn’t. It tasted like battery acid. He was very thirsty, but had to move on, looking for another water supply. Another problem that occured was, while he was becoming dehydrated more & more by the minute and unsteady on his bike, a huge snake lay across the road. He had to slowly maneuver around it, though it was hard, he was successful and continued down the road. The third ""obstacle"" he ran into was he was so thirsty and finally had a chance for a drink, when to his dissappointment, he found an old abandoned welches grape juice factory. As nervie and upsetting as it was, he continued to move on, still determined to make it to his destination. He finally came up to a fishing supply store where he was able to take a break and get a nice drink! Even though the setting was tough, teasing, and ironic, the man made it through and still with a smile on his face."	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
7428	3	The setting of the cyclist clearly influences his mood. From the beginning to end, the outside world reflects the tormils in his head. This is evident in the beginning reservoir, empty desert, hills the Welch factory, & finally the fish camp. The reservoir is a heven, @NUM1 safe ground that contains everything the men needs. He is feeling optimistic, ready & eager to follow advice of old men. He first hits a ghost town, which is foreshadowing a dangerous future. He passes through still with a level head. He comes to a water pump that gives him battery acid. This is wher the mood shifts. He suddenly describes his setting as “the high deserts of California.” The sun is boiling down & water is running low. His hopes start to drop. When the “flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,” it reflects the turmoil in his head. The terrain is harder the chances of his survival lessons. When he crosses a snake, it suggest even more despair. It finally climaxes at the Welch factory. How ironic, it is an abandoned juice factory. This is lost hope. When he finally arrives at the fish camp, he is relieved to be alive & is uplifted. The cyclist has made it. It is clear the setting has affected the cyclist.	3.0	3.0		3.0

He had problems with thirst already and had to deal with a snake that “really did look like a diamondback.” @CAPS2, he sees a building up ahead and discovers that it’s a walrus Grape Juice factory. He thought that is might have some water but realized it was abandoned. Relating to his thirst, before he left he grabbed some pebbles.” I’d read once that sucking on stones helps takes your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to circulate.” * @CAPS3 he came across a fishing camp and received instructions on how to go on.

He was on a long, hot raod, and he started taking stabs at the old men ''I made a mental note to change that paragraph'' (@NUM4) The man was not forced to take direction from the old man.

7443	3	THE FEATURES OF THE SETTING AFFECT THE CYCLIST BY IT BEING SO HOT OUTSIDE THAT HE COULD HAVE HAD PASSED OUT AND DIED. ALSO HE SAW A SNAKE THAT SCARED HIM TO DEATH BUT HE PASSED THE SNAKE. ALSO HE SAW A BUILDING THAT COULD PROBABLY HELP HIM BUT IT WAS ABANDONED,IT WAS A WELCH FACTORY THEN AS HE RUNS FURTHER DOWN HE SAW A FISH PLACE AND WENT TO THE BATHROOM TO GET SOME WATER then somebody asked him where he was going and they tined totzy him but he still had his map so he decided that he was going to use it instead of listening to other people.	2.0	3.0		3.0																					
7444	3	In the story “Rough Road Ahead” a cyclist takes some out of rate information from a couple of old guys as he went along following there directions he found out that there directions were out of rate and at points dangerous. Also the setting didn’t help because he was in a desert with ghost towns and it was very hot it didnt help him believe he was going to make it out alive. For example in the story when he enters the  fork in the road it says he found “several rusty pumps,” and “one ramshackle shed.” This probably didnt help him because he didn’t have alot of water left and it was really hot and he was losing confidence in himslef that he went get out and there were rusty pumps so he couldn’t get any water that was good. Also in the story it says that “There was no one in sight, not a bulding, car, or structure of any kind” and that setting affected him because in this part in the story he has cycled for a while and he has no water left and he is getting very exhausted a almost has no energy. Also it decreased his hopes because it says there wasnt a building, or a car anything so it was pretty, much a empty dessert that he was stuck in and he thought he wouldn’t setent of the dessert alive. In conclusion in the story “Rough road ahead” the setting in the story didn’t help the cyclist in his hope or confiendce of setting out because the setting was very abanded and also it was very hot and it didn’t help that he was in a desert.	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
7449	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a few ways. Early in the essay, the syclist states he “enjoyed the serenity of an early-summer evening and some lively conversation with these old codgers.” The cyclist was enjoying himself and the  atmosphere, but then the mood changed quickly to doubt when he didn't listen to the “collection of old-timers who havent left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office“ and his depleting water source quickly became a cause for concern. Doubt was soon followed by @CAPS1 when he saw the sign for Gary and Wilber’s Fish camp and was able to get a drink from the bathroom foucets @CAPS1 was then followed by satisfaction when he “promised himself right then that he'd always stick to [the very good map] in the future.   	2.0	3.0		3.0																					
7453	3	THERE ARE VAST FEATURES IN THE SETTING THAT AFFECTS THE CYCLIST. IN SEVERAL WAYS ONE FEATURE WOULD BE THE “SUN BEGINNING TO HEAT DOWN,” AS THAT MADE THE CYCLIST HOT AND THIRSTY. THE THIRSTY-NESS REDUFROM HIM TO USE HIS LIMITED SUPPLY OF WATER. SO THE SUN WAS ABLE TO EFFECT HIM A COUPLE OF WAYS. ANOTHER FEATURE THAT CAUSED SOME PROBLEMS FOR THE CYCLIST WERE THE RUN DOWN “GHOST TOWNS” THAT CONSISTS OF “RAM-SHACKLE SHEDS” AND “SEVERAL RUSTY PUMPS.” THESE FEATURES LED THE CYCLIST TO FEEL HOPELESSNESS, AS WELL AS THE PROBLEM THAT THEY DIN’T HAVE ANY WATCH FOR THEM TO FEEL UP WITH AS HE BECAME DEHYDRATED.  OBSTACLES SUCH AS “TUMBLEWEEDS” AND “PAVEMENT BLOCKING SNAKES” ALSO PLAYS A ROLE IN AFFECTING THE CYCLISTS AS HE MOVE ON THE “@NUM1 ROAD” ONLY DOING “12 MPH.” ONE FINAL, AND LAST OBSTACLE WAS THE TERRAIN HE RODE ON.  THE OBSTACLE BEING A “LONG CROPPING HILL,” THIS MADE THE CYCLIST EXHAUSTED, AS HE USES MUCH ENERGY TO SUMMER THE HELL, HE WAS ??? ???? ??? ???	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
7455	3	The features of the setting really affected the cyclist. The author wrote of rough terrain and isolation. “Flat roads was replaced by short, rolling hills tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake”. After reading this information and the descriptions. I inferred that the author was alone in the desert with awful conditions. I go inferal a tone of resentment also. He seemed to wish he hadn’t taken the “shortcut” that landed him in the desert. The hot weather was another factor that affected the author, trying to keep my balance in a dehydrated state. He seems to have not really planned how long the ride would be and how to conserve water. The rough terrain desolation and hot temperatures seemed to have affected the cyclist / author.	2.0	3.0		3.0																					
7456	3	"The features of the setting that most affected the cyclist were the water pump, the Welch’s Factory, and the fish camp. The pump affected him because he was very thirsty, and at first he thought he would have a chance to get water, he was excited and he pumped the water out, as he wrote, “with all my strength.” @CAPS1 he had to go on thirsty, (a very risky thing to do while cycling) because “it had the flavor of battery acid.” Next, the Welch’s Factory affected him by killing his spirits. He was already feeling bad from the lack of water, but seeing the mocking, ironic image of “a sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice”, made him feel worse. It reflected his own desperate situation, all refreshments in the past, there was nothing left. I had a similar experience once. I am alergic to peanuts. One time, on a long car trip, I had slept through lunch, so I was starving, and we were on a long stretch of highway with no buildings to be seen. After two hours, we finally saw a sign for a nearby restaurant: @CAPS2’s peanut shade. I nearly cried. The last thing that affected the cyclist was the fish camp. It saved his life. He arrived and ""drank deeply from the sinle.” He was so happy that he wanted to kiss the owners of the camp. This also relates to the car trip I mentioned, because after hours of hunger, we found a very good sush : bar, and sush: is my favorite food."	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
7467	3	"In the story ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Limit,"" the features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist. As he was riding, he was passing through desert during June, a very hot month.There is not much water present in a desert (that would be part of the definition of a desert) and so, particularly in the even-hotter-than-normal June sun, he was at risk of running out of water. Had he been driving through, say, a forest or perhaps rolling grasslands, he might not have been in such danger, and could have merely looked for a river or dreck for water if he was desperate. Another thing that might have affected the cyclist would have been the affect of the desert on his mind. When people think of deserts they often think of dry, barren wastelands, complete with buzzards and maybe a dead cowskull, as in movies. Deserts are in intimidiating, they have a bad reputation and so, as he was riding through and was low on water thought of death how he was, ""going to die and the birds would pick (him) clean"" running through his now-teriffied head. Had he been in a city or in rolling farmland he might not have been as terrified. There are people in those places, and places to be safe there, but, in his desert, he had neither, allowing him to give way to despair. Setting does a lot to influence stories, so it is important to keep that in mind when reading. "	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
7473	3	"In the setting of the essay; ""Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit."" had a great affect on the cyclist. It made him even more determined to finish because the terrain was so hard to ride through. For example, ""At some point, tumber weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake-it really did look like a diamond back-back the majority of the pavement in front of me, I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. ""The author fully explains how no matter how bad the obstacles are he comes across he keeps trying to easy on by. The terrain affect the character by keeping him determined. This happens to many people in their sports. For example in football they take any problems and use them as reasons to push themselves harder to finish the game. "	2.0	3.0		3.0																					
7478	3	In the essay by Joe Kurmaskie, he describes his experience of bike riding in the desert. The setting affects the cyclist in many ways throughout the writing. At first, Kurmaskie is confident as he listens to a group of old codgers giving him advice. The setting is calm and happy and Kurmaskie writes that he “enjoyed the serenity of an eary-summer evening”. The word “serenity” gives the affect of calm and peace. However, as Kurmaskie proceeds into his journey, the setting changes. He is troubled by the “ramshackle shed, several rutsy pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold the lamest mule” in a ghost town that he meets in the desert. Even later, the terrain changes and he sees a sign stating “Rough Road Ahead”. Kurmaskie’s confidence turns into even deeper doubt and worry as his water supply runs low. Finally, kurmaskie sees a sign for a fish camp. Here, his hope returns as he finds a “rather modern bathroom” where he can stop to get a drink. As the setting changes, Kurmaskie’s confidence is followed by determination and then relief.	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
7480	3	The story begins as the author, a cyclist, has taken directions from several very old men to reach his bike-ridden destination of Yosemite National park. He starts out confident enough and then reaches the first town the gentleman described. It is a ghost town and amuses the author still believing he’s perfectly fine he sets out again this time arriving at a place with “One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mule” It is at this point that the author starts to worry as his water supply is low. He preceeds past rolling hills, snakes, tumbleweeds and different land-marks. Each one rips his confidence and exciterent to shreds. Especially the juice factory as the author is currently very dehydrated and losing all hope. Finally, he arrives at the water he seeks in the form of “Gary wilber’s fish camp,” and refreshes himself and his dried-out hope. Each time the author passed a land-mark his confidence took a beating, and even though he was in dire physical health not having any hope for his sunny breezy vacation can drain a person even more from the inside out.	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
7487	3	Pride, determination, relief – all are things that the cyclist felt during his long bike ride. First the cyclist started of rideing on fresh legs and good directions, but after a while down the road he started to dought the old men, “a diary with my last entry in place of old men, their wisdom, and their been a sense of direction, I made a mental move to change it.” After feeling that the direction might be rough, he rode out of pride to get to his destination. Next the rider had great determination to get to his destination and did many things, “I gathered – a few pebbles and stock them in my mouth to take my mind off of thirst.” This quote shows that he would do almost anything to keep going. Finally the cyclist was fatigue when he arrived at the @CAPS1 shop because he then knew the old men were right and would reach his destination, “As I stumbled into rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink this quote shows he was polite naturally to get water but to know the men were right.	2.0	3.0		3.0																					
7491	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For one, a lot of the settings discoured the cyclist. “This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time- say, before the last world war- but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. As soon as the cyclist hits this “town” he realizes that the old mens advice might not have been so great. The dry desert affects the cyclist the most. This hot climate makes the cyclist extremely thirst, hot, and and sweaty. “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from a heatstroke...” The cyclist's tune here is sarcastic but he is still concerned about his health because of the heat and lack of water. The fact that there is nothing living around the cyclist also affects him. Since he’s talked to the old men for directions he hasn’t seen a glimpse of life, or buildings or anything. So this definetly discourages the cyclist and makes him lose his will to continue his journey. In conclusion, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. 	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
7493	3	In the essay, “Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,'' the cyclist is affected doth emotionally and physically by the features of the setting. At the start, when he came to a deserted shed with rusty pumps, he began to feel discouraged. “[The] sight was troubling,”(page @NUM1) @CAPS1 on in the essay, the terrain changes from flat land to short, rolling hills and tumbleweeds began to pass. The cyclist is definitely affected by the change in terrain. He is now exhaugnted but continues to pump his legs and ride on. Before the end of his ride, the cyclist reaches an abandoned @ORGANIZATION1. The setting how includes a large picture of a young boy drinking a refreshing glass of juice. The author seems almost detected by this. “I hung my head'' (page @NUM2) he confessed. In the end, once he finds an old fishermans store, he is relieved seeing the store from a distance excited the author, because, he could finally have a drink. The author mood and body were greatly affected by that features of the setting.	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
7502	3	"In the story, there are many features of the setting that affect the cyclist. One setting feature is the rolling of steep hills. The hills make the cyclist exhausted and even more desperate for water. For example, in the story it says, “Over one long crippling hill, a building came into view”. This shows that the hill was very hard and strenuous to get over. By using the word crippling it informs us that the hill was brutal and very hard to get over. Another setting I feature that affects the cyclist is the absence of any civilization on his cycling path. While he was riding he notices that there is nobody around to help him if he gets in trouble or needs water. The absence of people makes him feel stressed and worried about his journey. It shows this in the story when he say, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind”. Also it says in the story “I was going to die and the bird would pick me clean, leaving only some expensive out door gear and a diary with the last entry on the parse of old men"". This shows that there was nobody around to help him and he knew it. He thought he would die alone and that birds would eat him. He was obnonely worried about the absence of people."	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
7503	3	Usally the features, setting has an major affect upon the cyclist. The features, setting relates, and describes the hassh, and eventually relief condition of the cyclist. The setting relates to the person and plays a role, which the cyclist can observe. One reason how the features of the setting affects the cyclist is it shows the various problems that are being faced with the cyclist. For example, the cool pines, no one in sight, and I am alone. The way how this interepts a clear meaning, I the cyclist needs help getting home, and eventually by traveling, he needs water, to fill his thirst. Prior to thisy, the features, shows the weakness of the cyclist. For example, with that i believed it was my last burst of energy, as I consently, maneuvered down the hill. The features, and settings, affect the cyclist by showing how he was facing his troubles, thirst and fear, which all lead behind him at the end. These features and settings develop a clear understandmet, for the cyclist, and what is to be expected, in by him.	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
7504	3	"The features of the setting had a big impact on the cyclist. When he started that ride, he was confident that the “old timers” were right about which directions and roads he had to take to get to Yosemite National Park. Though the sun was bearing down, he refused to give up, just as he says” The sun was beginning to beat down, but I hardy noticed.” He came up to places that were worn down and deserted, so he knew he was alone if anything happened. The desert heat had made him down his water pretty regularly, so he tried to get more, as in, ""I got on my hands and knees When l tried a drop or two, it has the flavor of battery acid"" paragraph @NUM1. He was so thirsty that he would drink hot water. Then he thought he has only @NUM2 miles to go, so he kept going. He weakening as he pedaled along the changing terrain as he was “trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. “With what little energy he had last, he had passed an abandoned Well be Grape Juice factory, which probably tested his patience and sanity. He had resorted to, “gathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in my mouth” just to keep his mind his thirst. He was losing hope when he came upon “ Gary and wilber’s fish camp best bet” then he felt relieved after he was able to get cool water. By then he's learned his lesson, to stick to his map."	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
7505	3	"In the author's recollection of his long and tiresome bike ride he talked about the struggles he had to face. when he set out that morning he asked some old guys on a porch for directions to @CAPS1. They told him that they knew the way and that they knew a shortcut. He choose to take their advice but later regreted it. when he found the towns that they spoke of all he found was ghost towns. ""Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven't left the confines of their porches since carter was in office. ""He dose eventually reach a town were he finds signs of life. There he asks another old guy if he knows the way to Yosemite, the guy says he has a good map. All along his ride he was pleged by the sun and lack of watrer. The sun made him hot and thirsty which forced him to drink a lot of his water. when he rached his last few sips he resisted from drinking it and began loosing consciesness. ""I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June."""	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
7513	3	The cyclist became very tired and the area he was in did not help at all. he was in the desert in june very hot day and every town he had come to was abandoned and had no water. It was also very hilly which made the work even harder. 	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
7514	3	"The features in the setting of ""Rough Road Ahead, Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" affect the cyclist because the determine how easy or hard he ride is for the cyclist. For example. The land being hot, would enable him to die or heat struck without water, the land being dry means he doesn’t have a place to refill his water supply and the land being barren means to the man that if he didn’t be of heat stroke there is a chance he wouldn’t be found and wouldn’t survive. Another example of how the features of the setting offer the cyclist is in the story when the road gets rough and he sees the speed time sign his though are about here he is going a water depleating 12 mph. This shows that he features of the setting, namely the contour of the land and the roughness or he road make the journey a lot harder on the cyclist. The features of a setting could possibley be the biggest arrest on a cyclist, and whether they have a long hard journey in which they have to push themselves to the limit like in this story or a nice lersury ride."	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
7516	3	The cyclist was riding in some rough, dry and abandoned terrain that made his journey almost fatal. He described it as, “In the high deserts of California in June.” It was dry, lifeless and hot The sun was beating on him and he needed to frequently drink water, but he was running out. The empty towns were what he was wanting on for fresh water, but they’d been very abandoned. This made his journey very dangerous. He could’ve fallen off at any time because of heat stroke He would’ve died right then and there. His sweat was drying in the heat and there was no way for him to cool off in the lifeless desert: lifeless and dry. He had to enhance these extreme. Ironical conditions for miles on end, just to find some water. It was all that a desert is and all that a home shouldn’t go through.	2.0	3.0		3.0																					
7521	3	The features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist. For one, he was biking through the high deserts of California in June. This caused the cyclist to become overheated ad sweaty. So he drank from his water bottles frequently. Unfortunately, since there was, “no one insight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind,” he had nowhere to fill his bottles and become dehydrated. To make matters worse, the terrain changed from flat road to “short, rolling hills”. Normally, this would not cause too much struggle, but since he was dehydrated and overheated, each hill seemed “crippling”, My thoughts are that if the setting had been a bit cooler and perhaps on the time period the old men had lived in, the cyclist would have had a much more enjoyable experience.	2.0	3.0		3.0																					
7526	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by when the story says “Twenty miles up the road. I came to a fork of sorts”, This statement from the story affected the cyclist because he didn’t know which way to go. Another feature that affected the setting is when the story says “I got on my hand and knees, Working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength”. That statement shows that the cyclist was dieing for water and he didn’t think any was going to come out. Last feature that affected the cyclist was when the story says “Rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit. This shows that the rider had to go under a speed limit but he was earlier tired and he was going way under it and that he could make it up the rough road.	2.0	3.0		3.0																					
7528	3	In the text, the author was cycling to Yosemite park through a desert which dehydrated him and changed his mood. Going through this desert he ran out of water so he stopped. Some of the  towns he was told of which turned out to be deserted, and as he could not find water there he soon because dehydrated. This is the obvious affect the setting had on him, another affect was to cause him to doubt old people and to change his mood from confident to desperate. As he was cycling through the desert, desperately chinging to life in hopes he could find, are water, he realized that old people know of the past better than the future as they don’t get out to the every changing world as much as they used to whereas, at the beginning he was confident in the directions and wisdom of the old men. The setting he was in made him a little more wise.	2.0	3.0		3.0																					
7534	3	The features of the setting cause the cyclist two main problems: doubt and dehydration. From the essay, you can infer that the cyclist doubts he will ever make it to Yosemite because of the constant features in the essay that cause him to lose his hope and confidence. For example, near the end of the essay the cyclist is already exhausted and hopeless but then sees a building over a hill. He hurries to the building only to find out that it is an abandoned, run–down @ORGANIZATION1 factory. After getting his hopes up, he is forced to get back on his bike and carry on. This features of the setting causes further disappointment to the cyclist and installs more doubt into his mind. Despite losing his confidence and hopes to make it to Yosemite, the features of the setting also cause him a serious, literal problem: dehydration. The weather is not and he has to carry on over hills and on rough roads. He is running low on water and at the one town he finds the water from the pump is undrinkable. The features of the setting are causing him these problems and are the reason hid health is at risk.  	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
7539	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist in this story alot. Having unreliable directions, barely enough water for the journey, poor road conditions and other hazards like the heat and animals made this a very difficult journey for the cyclist. Starting the journey the cyclist recieved bad information on how to get to his destonation which lead him on a long hard journey with not much water. He says in the story “The speed limit was @NUM1. I was doing a water-depleting @NUM2”. This means he was running out of water too fast for the amount of land he was covering. Another feature of the netting that affected him was that the road conditions got worse and worse untill he reached a high way late in his journey. He said “flat road was replaced by short rolling hills."" This means the faster, easy, to ride terrain was replaced by slower harder to ride on terrain. These features of the setting could have been very dangerous and maybe factal and affected the cyclist alot living this story. "	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
7542	3	The features of the setting of “Do not exceed posted speed limit” greatly impact the cyclist, in a negative way. For example, when the road changes from smooth and easy to rolling and full of hills. It makes it difficult for him to bike. He needs to use more energy to get over the hills. Another example is when it says “tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.” The connection with seeing a tumbleweed is that of being deserted and alone so this increased his feelings of despair. Lastly, he sees the Welch’s Grape Juice Factory, which is deserted and serves to only make him thirstier. All of these things affect the cyclist. The fact that he sees the grape juice factory is also ironic, because he is extremely dehydrated and the factory is abandoned.	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
7543	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a few ways. first of these is the blazing heat. He is basically in a desert and he is running low on water. As he starts to run out of water he starts conserving it which is dehydrating him so he is becoming weaker, “I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or so- a test of my inner spirit. Next up is the rough terrain. When you hit rough terrain on a bike it can get hard to keep going and the cyclist was already short on water “a large highway sign jumped out at me. I read: rough road ahad: Do not exceed posted speed limit sometimes life can be so cruel“. Finally is the structure First there was the Ghost town with the “battery acid” tasting water. Also there was the Welch’s grape Juice factory and bottling plant which were both probably dimeriling. “A sandblusted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen. I hung my head”. As you can see the features of the settings generily affected the cyclist.	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
7545	3	"In the story Rough Road Ahead: do not excess speed limit, the reader sees the scenery and terrain get rougher, and lonelier, and as the cyclist travels and limits are being pushed his outlook is somewahat grim he only expects the worst. The rough road strats out after a water pump he finds gives him piping not, brackish water that tasted like battery acid. Water in a sense in this story is a metaphor to his life, and is the source for him living. In the beginning he drank it regularly and when he gets to the pump it is bad, just like when things start to turn sour in the story itself. The cyclist in this story is very a ware to how his body is and acknowledges his dehydration. At one point he says “and the growing realization that I could drop from a heat stroke simply because I had listened to some gentlemen who hadn’t been off their porches in a decade"" he later said it caused him to laugh sadly, hopelessly the lack of humans and their technology really broke him down."	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
7546	3	The desert is the crulest of nature’s environments. Its lack of water, dry air, and punishing heat are enough to kill even the hardiest creature. When traveling through a desert, one must maintain a constant water supply and know their path with respect to the power of nature in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, cycler Joe Kurmaskie must overcome the desert’s heat and lack of water to survive. As the author observes in paragraph @NUM1, “wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, I could drop from heatstroke.” If the human body overheats, it becomes sick and unable to properly function. When in the desert one must keep cool or perish. In @NUM2, Kurmaskie begins to realize the danger of running out of water in the desert, “ I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June. “As this water starts to run out, Joe suffers from dehydration, despair, and a loss of balance. Water is essential in a desert environment, without it, as Joe observes, “the birds would pick (you) clean, leaving only some expensive out door gear”.	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
7547	3	"The features in the setting of the essay “Rough Road Ahead Do not exeed the Posted Speed limit” affect the cyclist in a cruel manner. The old man say that the towns are going to be there and they are just not functioning towns. To make the cyclist feel hopeless the setting puts him in a California day in June which is extremely hot and puts in all these unexpected twists. A cruel thing to add in the essay was when it read “The Speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water depleting 12 mph” This lowers the cyclists confidence making him seem more worried. Another cruel thing is the author adding a welch’s Grape Juice factory that had been abandoned with “A sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring @NUM1 refreshing glass of juice into his mouth"" totally causing him to lose hope left. These features in setting are cruel."	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
7548	3	The features in the setting, such as the ghost town desert, and the Juice factory, give the cyclist a sense of hopelessness. He is running out of water when he comes to the ghost town, which he thought was @CAPS1 because the next town was only a short ways down the road. However when he came to the next “town” and attempted to use the water pump, a rather hot, foul liquid came up instead of water. He was beginning to lose hope when he came to the Welch’s factory, abandoned. All hope from him at that point was lost, claiming “the birds will pick me clean,” To the cyclist also was best, then he was “saved” by a bait shop. These features in the setting gradually emptied his hope little by little, until he came to the Bait shop after which his hope, but certainly not his fait in old men, was returned.	2.0	3.0		3.0																					
7554	3	The features of the nearby setting affect the cyclist in a bad way. The four main things that affect him are the heat, lack of water, lack of nearby buildings, and @CAPS2. For this cyclist one of the biggest problems is the heat. He says” i was travelling through the high deserts of California in June”. this shows that it is quite hot outside by the month stated. June is quite a hot month especially in @CAPS1 deserts. The second problem is the cyclist lack of water. He says throughout the story how thirsty he is and how much he needs to drink some water. When he reaches the end, however he finds water. The third problem is when he needs water, he can’t find anywhere due to the lack of buildings. He pedals great distances trying to find “towns” nearby. Once he finds them, they are either “ghost towns” or are not useful at all. The final problem he faces is the @CAPS2. He says “At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake… blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.” @CAPS2 is getting in his way and not helping him to reach his destination at all. Truly . the features of the nearby setting are affecting him in a tramatizing way, because so many things like heat, lack of water , buildings, and @CAPS2 are inches way.	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
7561	3	"The setting in the story had a big effect on the cyclist. The hot deserted surroundings made the cyclist become tired or discoveraged. For example the cyclist observes, ""one ramshacure shed, several rusty pumps, and a comes that couldn't hold in the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was trouble."" This quote shows the old, beat down environment worried him. Also the author says, ""there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind."" In this quote, the cyclist realizes his isolation, and begins to become more determined to reach his destination. Realize, ever been lost, then youknow that it can be discouraging if there's no sign of life around you. All you want to do is keep going and hope you can find your way.

7563	3	"In the narrative ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist was affected in a deadly negative way by the setting. The cyclist is travelling through “The high deserts of California in June.” It was hot, so hot the infact, that the author realized he could “drop from heatstroke” at anytime. This unbearable heat, coupled with the “crippling” hilly terrain was enough to reduce the cyclist to a stale of severe dehydration. Obviously not exactig a positive effect. The swelting heat and merciless hills of the setting would not be quite so awful if there had been locations to stop, rest and replenish the eyeishes diverting water supply. However, “There was no one in sight, not a building, or a structure of any kind” The cyclist was incomplete isolation for over @NUM1 miles of arid desert, the sweating sun heating down upon him as he toiled up steep unyielding hills clearly the setting was affecting the cyclist in horribly negative way."	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
7571	3	The features effect the setting of the story in a big way. At the beginning of his ride there are people around and he has no troubles. After he talks to the old men and starts on his ride to the @NUM1 town there is no one around. There are no buildings in site at all and no source of water. Since there was no one around his confidence of actualy completing the trip begar to go down. Once he arrived at the first town he noticed that it was an old town and no one was there anymore. This made him mad and his confidence dropped a lot. Once he reached the next building he noticed that there was no one there either and then thought hed never make it and that he die. Once he reached the final place it was a more occupied setting. There were people around. He then began to feel relieved that he could get water. The setting with no one around make him lose a lot of confidence.	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
7574	3	The features of the setting in “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit” greatly affect the cyclist. I’m sure that the heat makes the cyclist more thirsty, and heat can also drain energy extremely fast. Being in “the california desert in the middle of June” does not sound like an enjoyable time to be riding a bike. When the cyclist got tired and exhausted from not having any water, I’m sure that riding past all of the empty land had an effect on his attitude. I think that seeing a building made him get excited, and then when he found out that it was nothing more than an abandoned building, his spirits greatly dropped. He probably felt that he couldn’t continue for very much longer simply because all of the buildings he came across were empty, or abandoned. When the cyclist reached the bait store, he probably felt much better, and very relieved to have gotten there before he had a heat stroke.	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
7575	3	"When the cyclist passed through the old towns the old man told him to, the setting played a big part in making his situation harder to overcome when he passed through the first abandoned town, the water source was dry and empty. The text says ""pumped the handle for several minutes but the water would not cool it tasted like battery acid.” The second drink source he passed was on abandoned @PERSON1’s Juice factory. The text says,‘a sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth.” These two objects made his situation mentally harder to get through because he was so close to what he needed numerous times, then it was taken away."	2.0	3.0		3.0																					
7577	3	There are many different features such as the weather, road condition, and how the person is feeling.

7578	3	According to the essay features of the setting affect the cyclist. If the cyclist is in the middle of a hot desert in June with no water, the cyclist will become excessively thirsty the longer they go. For example; the author states “I had been hitting my bottles pritty regularly, and I was traveling through the high desert of California in June”. The terrain changes to short, rolling hills from flat land causing the cyclist to push herself to get the next town to get water. For instance; she states “over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view”. This cause the cyclist to use what they thought of as their last burst of energy to get down there, but the building was abandoned, thus making the cyclist feel let down. As the cyclist continued on a setting of a bait store came and the cyclist felt relief because now she could get water. These examples show the change of setting on the cyclist’s trip and how it affected her.	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
7583	3	"As the setting changes in the story, so does the cyclist’s narrator’s mood. His mood changes from happy and confident to indifferent and scared. At first the cyclist is so happy about Yosemite that he is just care free and no worries at all. He says that, “I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.” Even at his first “ghost town” he just “chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on”. After this point he could not be so care free. After this town he came to, “One ramshackle shed, several thirsty pumps, and men”. He said, “this was troubling”, it was very hot and he had been drinking his water pretty often. He said that, “He failed on."" He started to get sort of scared he realized that he could, ""drop from a heatstroke."" He was scared that because of his idea to believe the old men he might possibly die. He finally get happy when he reaches the bait shop and he got his drink. From then on the stock to his map. His attitude changed greatly throughout the story."	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
7590	3	"The author made the setting seem long and unbearable, felt of undesirable heat and lack of water at hand.

7591	3	In the story, “Do not exceed postal speed limit,” many features of the setting affect the cyclist. First and most importantly, he is affected by the people who live there. “Never accept travel advice from a group of old- timers who haven’t left the confines of their porch since Carter was in office.” This quote describes the feelings the cyclist has towards the old men. Because he listened to their directions, he traveled through ghost towns and hourly died from dehydration. Also, the lack of people and civilization affected the author. There was no one around that he could ask for help from. “…but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. Here, the author is trying to stop for water, but since no one lives in the town any more, he gets none. Finally, the lack of water has a huge effect on the cyclist. “That smoky blues tune “Summer time” rattled around in the dry honey combs of my deteriorating brain.” This describes how the author is really dehydrated and he feels like his brain is drying up. However, his need for water makes him more determined than ever to keep going until he reaches another town, or this goal destination of reaching Yosemite National Park.	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
7599	3	"The features of the environmental setting is affecting the cyclist. A setting is a certain time and place an event is taking place along with the setting their are features, which is the background description basically giving away additional information about the subject or idea. The features along with the setting are intefering with the cyclist by the hot temperature in Lodi, California making the cyclist or biker hotter than usualier as he heads in the wrong direction closer and nearer to the hot blazen scroaching desert. In addition to this he is running out of water and is beginning to get more and more exhausted from the heat plus he is starting to lose consciousness along with getting dehydrated. This is a major problem for the character because he is losing his sense of direction and because of this he is getting more panickly as his supply of water is running extremely low. A instance of the environmental setting affecting the cyclist is “I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweet circled my skirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heartstroke on a gorgeous in June ""(Joe Kurmaskie, @NUM1)."" @CAPS1 example is “This sight was troubling. I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly and I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June “(Joe Kurmaskie, @NUM2)”. The hotness and heat had also increased the character’s confidence in himself as he was getting more and more panickly. A instance of this is “I began breaking the ride down into distances. I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it this far, I’d be fine “(Joe Kurmaskie, @NUM1). In conclusion, the hot setting in California had affected the cyclist in a number of ways it had exhasted his water supply and this caused him to become exhausted, dehydrated, and making him lose his logically sense to make decisions however his loss of sense of direction also gave him more self confidence as he stirved to the roads and serves town that was about twenty miles away in order to get water so that he @MONTH1 survive."	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
7605	3	The features of the setting like the dessert the sun and abondered towns affect the cyclist alot. The dry dessert makes him feel as if he were riding forever. And probably makes him wonder if he is ever going to make it to a town. The sun makes hime even  hoter not  he already is makes him sweat more and makes him even more thirsty.The abandoned towns make him lose hope in finding water or even if he is ever doing to make to yosomite. The mood of this story goes from content to sad to happy.

Then he becomes happy when he finds the bait shop an finds water.	2.0	3.0		3.0																					
7606	3	"In “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist negatively. The story takes place in June in California. This is a very hot time of the year in such a desert location. The heat adds to the speed at which the cyclist becomes dehydrated, as well as his inability to think as coheratly as he could had he not been in a desert in June. The cyclist is also travelling through desolate, an inhabited land. The author says, “There was no one in sight, not a building car, or structure of any kind.” This emphasizes the characters total lack of resources. There is nowhere within sight that he can turn to for help, water, food or shelter. The road was also rough, plagued with many rolling, crippling hills. Such terrain is much harder to manuver, especially in such a are state of despair. The setting of the story, ""Rough Road Ahead"" greatly impacts the cyclist."	2.0	3.0		3.0																					
7613	3	"The features of the setting make the cyclist feel hopeless after realizing he is not on a short cut. The cyclist has the ""growing realization that [he] could drop from heatstroke"" as he rides along. Also, the only building he sees for miles ""had been @NUM1 Welch's Grape Juice Factory."" The cyclist is driven deeper into despair and feels that all hope is lost when he sees this building. As he rides on, the song ""'@ORGANIZATION2' rattled aroung in the dry honeycombs of (his) deteriorating brain."" At this point, the cyclist believes his own death to be inevitable. He saysown death to be inevitable. He says “with any luck I’d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat” when talking about pebbles he placed in his mouth. Finally, the cyclist reaches a small bait shop, and all hope is returned as he “drank deeply from the sink.” The desert setting, with its lack of water, shelter, and people was the cause of this mans concern and later panic about his own life. The hopelessness of this cyclist is much like the hopelessness of those in the @ORGANIZATION1, who trapped in a blizzard far from civilization, resorted to eating their dead just to survive. While the @PERSON1 @ORGANIZATION1 went to extremes for their survival, their setting caused them to feel the same hopelessness as the cyclist."	3.0	3.0		3.0

7623	3	Many things can affect a cyclist. But in the story three main features of the setting affected the cyclist the most. While the cyclist was riding it was very hot. We know this by looking back at the text. It gives us this quote, “That I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June.” Because it was hot. This could make the cyclist thirsty. Another feature of the setting was the multitude of hills. This would create exhaustion. We know their were many hills because in the text it says.” Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.” Going over all those hills can really tire someone out. A third feature of te setting would be nature. Nature can affect us in many ways, by weather, by terrain, as in this case by animals. In the story the cyclist comes upon a large snake. This making it dangerous. The setting can affect anything. It would have been a totally different story if the cyclist had been in the summer during @DATE1, not June.	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
7624	3	In the essay “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed @CAPS1,” the setting is used to alter the cyclists mood and as a reflection of his situation. For example, the statement “the cool pines and rushing river of Yosemite had my name written all over them” helps describe the cyclist situation. The idea of lush, cool water vegetation gives the @CAPS4 hope during his increasinlgly hellish trip. The beauty of that setting also reflects on the comfort that would come from reaching Yosemite; the good setting equal a good out come. Later on, the cyclist comes across “one ramshackle shed, several rusts pump, and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest make.” This is a depressing setting symbolizing a complete loss of hope. And inteact at this point the cyclist becomes troubles to his situation. While pedaling through desert, the cyclist becomes even more factory when tumble seed, which is always a symbol of a deserted area, cones by. The nile of setting to affect and mirror mood is nothing new. There are many examples of this literary technique throughout history. For example, in his story “The @CAPS2 of @CAPS3 @PERSON1.” @CAPS4 @PERSON1 was a deslated land filled wild beast to symbolize and cause @PERSON2 to change his personalith surrounded by uncivilized people and creating @PERSON2 tears of his clothes and hunt like a dog. The setting of a desert in the uncultured. Part of colonial simultaneously cause and reflects on this change. The setting in the essay “Do Not Exceed posted Speed Limit” is used as an important for character development.  	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
7625	3	The features of the essay explain how the features of the setting affect the cyclist for many reasons. When the author writes tumbleweeds crossed my path” it shows that he is most likely in the middle of nowhere. This is true because tumbleweeds are usually signs in movies and t.v. shows that the place is deserted. Also, when the author writes” the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke” and when he writes “a ridiculously large snake” show the growing danger that he is getting himself into. This is true because the snakes could get a tany time or he could just collapse from the lack of water and die. Lastly, the name of the store is revelant because it is a fish bait store and he is thirsty. This is revelant because fish live in water and he is thirsty and seeing the sign relieves him completely. Therefore, the features of this essay explain how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	3.0	2.0		3.0

He was a bike peddaling threw the California desert with the things you can carry cause your on a bike. He ran out of water and could of got heatstroke or colapsed in the middle of nowhere with no one around to save him. So the heat gone drive you insane and make you thirty and you have a bite.

The real vies of the setting affected him, because there was so many optical that he had to overcome, for  example, he  got directions  from some old men who move then lively didn’t really know what they were talking about. Then he ran out of water so he had nothing to drink and the road started to get bumpily and he saw snakes. There were no buildings nor cars around so he had no way of asking anybody for help if needed. He came  up on an old factory, that was thought to be the Welch’s Grape juice, factory, but was abandoned and looked like it had been for a while, towards the end he found this fish came where he finally got water and was around people.

Finally, the cyclist's water supply was running low. “the water bottles contained only a few tantalizing  sips.” Not having a lot of water is really bad when your outside in the heat and the cyclist had no idea where to find more.

Then he came to a fork in the road and was running out of water. He had been riding on flat road when the terrain dramatically changed. It became hilly and very inconsistent. This sudden change in terrain caused him to get more tired, thirsty, and hot. The cyclist then came to a huge hill and, using his last bit of energy, rode down. He was exhausted. All the terrain changes not only changed the cyclist’s physical state, but his mood and determination as well.  "	3.0	2.0		3.0

He thinks the shortcut will be a nice way to relax than to take the original longer way to Yosemite. But the trip he makes changes his mind a lot. In the essay the narrator is talking about what the old guys had told him. He says, “The old guys had sworn the next town only eighteen miles down the road. I could make that. I would conserve my water…” He did conserve his water but the town was very old and didn’t have any water for him to drink. So throughout the essay the narrator went without water until he got to a factory, got some water to drink, and got new directions. The trip was very different from what he had expected. It was more depressing.	3.0	3.0		3.0

Which inturn affected him physically by becoming dehydrated as moments passed. So overall that setting features had a negative direction affect on the cyclist. Another example, ""One ramshacked shed, several rusty pumps, and a coral that couldn't hold in the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was troubling."" This affected the cyclist mentally by making him think he was never going to see civilization again. It also affected him physically because the water tasted like ""battery acid"" which put him deeper into his dehydration state. This setting features had a negative affect on the cyclist.

The text says, “The speed limit was @NUM1. I was doing a water- depleting @NUM2.” In this part of the story it proves that the cyclist is out of water. In this kind of setting you can run into dangerous creatures. In the story it says, “I toiled on. At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake. It really did look like a diamondback-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.” This entry proves to the reader that there are snakes in this sort of setting.

The passage that supports this is when he drops,"".distances I could see on the horizon, telling myself that @CAPS1 could move it that far, I’d be fine.” In the story,"" Rough road ahead, Do not exceed posted speed limit, by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of his settings affect both they cyclists physical and mental abilities"	2.0	3.0		3.0																					
7694	3	"The features of the setting have a huge effect on the cyclist. There was a point in the story where he ran out of water ad he remembered that the old guys had sworn the next town was only eighteen miles down the rode. He was tired ad dehydrated but he thought he could make it along the road. So he started off and the two miles later the terrain changed and so did his outlook on this entire journey. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. ""Sometimes life can be so cruel.” @CAPS1 hills took a lot out of him and he was now on a highway. Before this terrain change the rider is very positive and thinks he can do this easily. “I could make that!” But after the terrain change he looses hope and almost don’t make it. “It didn’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” It is obvious as you read that when the terrain becomes tough it has a huge negative effect on the cycilists."	3.0	2.0		3.0																					
7700	3	The cyclist in this essay is trying to go to Yosemite National Park. He feels confident in him making it, not realizing what is up ahead. First comes the windy roads. As he goes along his confidence starts to wither away. The desert hits him like a boulder because he is running short on water and needs to rest. The extreme heat just makes everything worse. “Not the miley into this heat section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. “This shows that the cyclist did not expect to meet this kind of terrain and is over whollmed by it. The one thing he never does is give up. This is important because as he went along, just before hagon up, he found a place to get water and to relax. “Then, as easily as running about, my troubles thirst, and nor were all behind me” This shows that he was strong and determined to survive and he finally found what he needed and it made happy and have a will to live. Everyone in life needs to be determined.	3.0	3.0		3.0																					
7702	3	The features of the setting very much affect the cyclist. He had to ride through tough conditions and became very exhausted. I believe the toughest feature of the setting was the heat. He told us, “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.”  He was talking about how he needed to sip from his water more than normally. Another tough feature of the setting was the hills he had to ride up and down. As he was riding he said, “Flat road was replace by short, rolling hills.” I believe riding over these hills in the hot @DATE1 in a California desert was a very tough task for the cyclist. I believe the terrain very much affected him.	2.0	3.0		3.0																					
7708	3	The features of the setting in “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” greatly affect the cyclist. Depending on what sort of new terrain or landmark he came to,his determination increases and decreases. For example, when he saw a building come into view ahead of him, he got excited and used all his energy to get down the hill to the building. Also, when he came to the next building and found a working bathroom, he drank from the sink as his hope (of not dying) was renewed. The man riding the bike in the story had many different changes in his emotions during his long trek in this story that were dependent on the setting. 	2.0	3.0		3.0
