1	3	"The setting seems to be as formidable an opponent as the actual workout. It seems as if everything is against the cyclist, including nature. As the day progresses, and the cyclist’s journey continues, the setting becomes harsher and harsher. After passing the first “town”, the “sun was beginning to beat down.” In need of water, all a cruel pump gives him is “a tarlike substance.” His sufferings continue, increasingly pummeled by his surroundings and his thirst for water. If dehydration was not enough, the flat terrain gave way to “rolling hills”, which would only punish his legs more. Reaching possible salvation, his hopes are crushed when the “Welch’s Grape Juice Factory” turns out to be abandoned. All these events are enough to destroy anyone’s spirit. The cyclist almost gives up hope to accept certain death. He has become ferociously beaten by his very surroundings. It appears as if he is fated to die alone in the blistering heat. Although he hangs his head in despair, he still continues on the path of disappointment. In a twist of fate, he encounters a thriving store where he halts and drinks. Finally encountering his salvation, this particular setting brings new hope and relief to the cyclist who has finally survives his trek through nature."  	2.0	3.0		3.0
