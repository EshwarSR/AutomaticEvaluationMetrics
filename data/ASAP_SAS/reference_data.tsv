Whereas, a python can adapt to any environment it is put in and it is able to eat anything.
5785	3	2	1	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are both specialists; both species eat only a certain plant. The pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo and the koalas only eat eucalyptus leaves. Those two animals are different from pythons because pythons are generalists, which means that they can adapt to almost any also where as specialists cannot.
5790	3	2	2	The similarities between pandas and koalas is they don't eat meat. Pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves.

5799	3	2	1	Pandas of China are like koalas in Australia because they both are very reliant on one source for food, bamboo for pandas and eucalyptus leaves for koalas. Pythons in contrast, and eat a variety of things which makes it a generalist, while pandas and koalas are specialist.
5800	3	2	1	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they mostly eat only one food. ""A specialist is China's panda, which eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's koala bear, which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively"". They are both different from a python because a python will eat anything which is a generalist."
5809	3	2	2	They are both similar because they both only eat one thing. Pandas only eat bamboo and koalas era eucalyptus leaves. A python will eat anything. In 2005 a python swallowed an alligator. It exploded, but it still tried to eat it. They eat only meat while the koala and panda do not eat only meat. As long as a python is hungry enough it will clearly resort to any food source.
5814	3	2	2	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because both animals eat plants, but not the same type of it. I say this because in the article it says "" China's panda which eats almost nothing but bamboo, or koala which eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's koala bear which eats eucalyptus leaves."" It."
5815	3	2	2	Pandas and the koalas both are herbivores, while the python is a carnivore.
5819	3	2	2	Like the koala bear in Australia, one pandas in China have a diet of one food and one food only. Pandas only eat bamboo, and koalas bears feed to only eat leaves he stated in paragraph 21. Both animals are different from a python, who eats a variety of other living creatures.

5825	3	2	1	Pandas and koalas are both specialist animals. They only eat strictly certain foods such as bamboo and eucalyptus leaves. Compared to a generalist python that is easier to adapt to new food and enviornments.
5826	3	2	2	Pandas in china and koalas in Australia are similar in the way that they only eat things that come from their natural habitat, they are different from the python because the python can live in other places and adapt to the food resources that come from there.
5832	3	2	1	"Pandas and koalas are both similar due to the fact that they both eat certain foods almost exclusively. In paragraph 21 it states that pandas eat ""almost nothing but bamboo,"" while koalas eat "" eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively"" These animals are both different to pythons as pythons are ""generalist"" and can eat nearly anything."

5838	3	2	2	The panda and the koala bear are both specialist because they only eat one thing but a a python differs from a koala or a panda because it's a generlist so it eats more than one thing and there an abundance of their speices.
5840	3	2	2	Pandas and koalas are both considered specialists whereas pythons are generalists. Pandas can only eat bamboo and koala bears mostly eat eucalyptus leaves. On the other hand a python can eat many different things and has many more options.
5844	3	2	2	Animals have been divided into two sections; specialists and generalists. Robray MacInnes distinguishes between the the two by saying that generalists favor change and specialists favor stability. The Chinese panda and the Australian koala are two specialist species. They rely on one exclusive food source. The python, a generalist, is extremely adaptive and is not roled to one single food supply.
5849	3	2	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they only eat one type of food. Pandas only eat bamboo and koalas only eat eucalyptus leaves.

They both have limited diets, mainly eating 1 food, for the panda it's bamboo and for the koala it's eucalyptus leaves. These animals differ from the python because it is called a ""generalist"" and the python is carnivorous and can eat anything."
5853	3	2	1	China Panda's and koala bears are specialist because panda's eat almost nothing but bamboo & Australia koala bears eat nothing but eucalyptus leaves. However, pythons is a generalist and can eat just about anything anywhere unlike China panda's and Australia koala bears.
5854	3	2	1	"The China's panda and australia's koala bear are both specialists. They both eat a specific food. The panda eats almost nothing but panda. And bear ""eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively."" The python is a generalist which means it can adapt to different types of food; that also makes the python less stable i like the specialists."
5855	3	2	1	Panda's in china are similar to koalas bears in Australia in a way because  they are both specialists.This means that they have to be in an environment that supports their specific needs, lik an abudance of bamboo or eucalyptus. Python are different because, as generalist, the can thrive in many similar environments.
5856	3	2	2	Pandas in China are very similar to koalas in Australia because panda bears eat's nothing but bamboo, and koala bears eat eucalyptus . They are both different from pythons because pythons can swallow an alligator.

5870	3	2	2	Panda's and koalas are both specialists. That means they can not adapt well because they only eat pretty much one thing such as bamboo or eucalyptus leaves. Pythons however can adapt  and find food, and are therefore generalists. An example of a python adapting is in Florida, where they can eat Key Largo wood rats and other species.
5871	3	2	2	China's panda Australia's koala are similar as they are both considered as specialists. The article states that both animals eat a certain food present only in their native environment.

This shows that pythons can really go anywhere and panadas and koalas are limited."
5876	3	2	2	Pandas in china are similar to koalas in Australia because they both belong to the specialist group,due to their very limited diet and inability to adapt to most places.This contrasts them from pythons because pythons can adapt to most environments due to the variety of food they eat.
5877	3	2	2	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia in the same  that they are both specialist species. This meaning that they generally only eat one type of food, as described in paragraph 21. They both differ from a python because a python is able to move easily adapt to several different foods because it is a generalist species.
5878	3	2	1	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are both specialists; both species eat only a certain plant. The pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo and the koalas only eat eucalyptus leaves. Those two animals are different from pythons because pythons are generalists, which means that they can adapt to almost any also where as specialists cannot.
5881	3	2	2	Koalas and pandas are both specialist animals that only eat a cenant type of plant. Well a python is a generalist and eats any thing that is isining and small enough.
5883	3	2	1	Pandas and koalas are both specialist species. They both could not naturally survive outside of their habitats because they only eat things that are native to China or Australia. Pythons can survive in many places because their bodies were made to eat a variety of animals.
5886	3	2	2	China's panda eats nothing but bamboo, Australia's koala bear that eats eucalyptus. The python would try to eat anything that it thinks its able to to eat.
5889	3	2	1	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they eat almost nothing, they eat leaves, bamboo, etc. They don't harm other wildlife animals. Pythons eat wild life animals. Pandas and koalas are better for the environment. In the article it says ""pandas which eat almost nothing"". The difference is habitat, and what they prey on."
5893	3	2	2	According to the article, both pandas from China and koalas from Australia are similar because they are both specialists. This means they are both dependent selective food source. On the other hand, the article describes pythons as generalists because they could live almost anywhere in the world, have they the opportunity to.

5904	3	2	1	"Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are both specialist animals they are both adapied to one habitat. The article explains that China's panda eats almost nothing but bamboo"" and that koalas in Australia eat eucalyptus leaves ""almost exclusively."" They differ from pythons because the python is a generalist, which is an animal that can live and adapt to almost anywhere."
5905	3	2	2	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia, are specialist animals; they live in the places they do because it has the food it needs to survive.

The python however is a generalist it can live anywhere because its able to adapt to its surroundings.
5906	3	2	2	A panda and a koala bear are similar because they pretty much each only one specific thing. Where as the python eats just about everything.
5914	3	2	2	Pandas and Australia's koala bears are similar. In the way that they both just eat mainly one type of plant. Unlike pandas and koala bears. The python eats many other things. That makes it a possible invasive species.
5917	3	2	2	"China's panda and Australia's koala are similar in that they have very specific food needs whether it is ""nothing but bamboo"" or ""eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively.""

5921	3	2	2	Panda's and kolas are similar by both eating certain foods like bamboo and eucalyptus leaves and thats how they are both specialist. Unlike the python who is a generalist who can live anywhere because food is abundant. Theres only certain places pandas and kolas can live but as pythons begin to expand they live everywhere.
5922	3	2	2	They both are different from pythons; one they can live in any conditions while pythons need to stay close to the Equator. For and pandas and koalas mostly eat leaves and stuff like that. But pythons eat other animals.
5927	3	2	1	Pandas are similar to koalas Australia because they both rely on one food source. Pandas can only survive on their bamboo while koalas can only survive on their eucalyptus leaves. They differ from pythons because pythons can eat a wide range of food so it is able to live in other places of the world other than its native country.
5928	3	2	2	The ultimate generalist is, arguably, a human being, who with the assistance of technology can live anywhere, from Florida to Antarctica to outer space. I think panda and koalas was same specie. They were spread then appear similar species.
5931	3	2	2	Pandas in China eat basically only bamboo and koalas in Australia basically only eat eucalyptus leaves. There fore it is hard for them to live in any other and find or environmental. Unlike the python which they dont have a problem with migrating and adapting in other environments.
5932	3	2	2	"Pandas in China and Koalas in Australia are both specialist species and ""what favors specialists is stability""(5). Both species rely on specific conditions such as climate and food sources which restrict them from living anywhere else.
